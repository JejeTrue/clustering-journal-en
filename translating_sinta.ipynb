Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk memberikan kontribusi mengenai penilaian kinerja dengan pendekatan balanced scorecard dengan mengangkat studi kasus pada PT Adhi Karya (Persero) Tbk dengan tahun kajian 2010 sampai dengan tahun 2011. Penelitian ini diharapkan dapat memberikan implikasi bagi pemangku kepentingan seperti perusahaan dan manajemen, karyawan perusahaan, investor, calon investor, supplier, kreditur dan rekanan perusahaan. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan bahwa kinerja PT Adhi Karya (Persero) Tbk pada tahun 2011 lebih baik dari tahun 2010.

The model developed in this paper rigorously shows the impact of treating costs that are not volume related as if they are. The model demonstrates that the source of product cost distortion is the difference between the proportion of driver used by each product in ABC and the proportion of the base used by the same product in the conventional costing systems. The difference arises because the conventional costing systems ignore the existence of batch-related and product-related costs. The model predicts a positive association between volume and size diversity with product cost distortions. When interaction between volume and size diversity exists, the distortion is either mitigated or exacerbated. The magnitude of the distortion is jointly determined by the size of the differences and the size of the total indirect costs.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8623,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"UKURAN DEWAN, KEBERAGAMAN DEWAN DAN PENGUNGKAPAN TANGGUNG JAWAB SOSIAL PERUSAHAAN: PERAN KONEKSI POLITIK\",\n          \"Persepsi Mahasiswa Program Studi PGPAUD terhadap Implementasi Life Skills dalam Program MBKM\",\n          \"An Alternative to Optimize  the Indonesian\\u2019s Airport Network Design: An Application of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Technique\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1580,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2019-09-04\",\n          \"2021-04-09\",\n          \"2009-03-11\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"journal\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES\",\n          \"JURNAL KESEHATAN ANDALAS\",\n          \"JURNAL OBSESI: JURNAL PENDIDIKAN ANAK USIA DINI\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"data_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8629,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"an application of multimodal text-based literacy activities in enhancing early children's literacy one of the most important development programs in early childhood education is language development the purpose of this study is to develop literacy activities using multimodal text-based literacy activities for early childhood in one of the kindergartens in Pematangsiantar qualitative descriptive methods are applied in this study the data sources for this study are early childhood as many as students observation interviews and documentation are used to obtain data triangulation techniques and source triangulation are used in data analysis the process of interpreting the collected data using qualitative descriptive analysis this study experienced an increase in the comfort of the learning environment for students with an average increase percentage of so that this multimodal-based literacy activity is feasible to be developed and implemented in early childhood the researchers also suggest that schools understand the importance of building a good literacy environment in the classroom in supporting the application of multimodal-based literacy for the development of children's literacy skills\",\n          \"The purpose of this study is to see the impact of the three independent variables on the profitability of BPR in Denpasar City. This research period was conducted at BPR in Denpasar City. The number of samples taken was 100 units with a purposive sampling method. Data collection was carried out using non-participant observation. Multiple linear regression is an analysis technique used based on the results of the analysis. All regression models passed the classical assumption test. From the results of the analysis that had been carried out, it was found that the three variables had a simultaneous effect on the profitability of BPR in Denpasar City. The profitability of BPR in Denpasar City was influenced by the three independent variables by 100 percent. The remaining 100 percent was influenced by other factors that were not included in the partial test model. It showed that only the variable of growth in the number of credit customers had a partial effect on the profitability of BPR in Denpasar City. To increase the profitability of BPR, the quality of human resources should be improved and provide the best service for each customer, especially credit customers, and try to increase the number of healthy and effective credit customers.\",\n          \"implementation of community-based education management in early childhood education quality assurance this study aims to find out more information about the implementation of community-based education management in organizing early childhood education quality assurance the method used in this study is descriptive with a qualitative approach the data collection technique used is interviews and documentation studies the results of the study show that in ra alhilal cikarang it is greatly influenced by community involvement community participation is used as an approach through two main strategies namely the culture of transparency in the management of educational resources and the application of a culture of accountability in organizing community-based education management in early childhood education quality assurance\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"eissn\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1372963,\n        \"min\": 20771223,\n        \"max\": 26569124,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          23382449,\n          26151138,\n          25498959\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"jid_umum\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 12,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          11,\n          10,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","\n","#Check unique values of 'jid' column\n","unique_jid_values = df['jid'].unique()\n","print(f\"Unique values of 'jid' column: {unique_jid_values}\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KU5BvNRFuQ8k","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737913670059,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":516,"user":{"displayName":"jihaan drive","userId":"12927300954231845175"}},"outputId":"a094b34a-9e64-44a4-b7b0-d1db265915ed"},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Unique values of 'jid' column: [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12]\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
