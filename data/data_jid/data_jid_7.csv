7,"Employees are viewed as one of the company's important assets and need to be managed and developed to support survival and achieve company goals. One form of employee organization that can be carried out by the company is to provide remuneration or salary payments that are appropriate for employees. Salary increases greatly affect employee motivation and productivity in carrying out and completing their work. To determine the amount of salary increase, a system is needed that can support decision making by managers. The use of decision support systems using simple additive weighting (SAW) method is very helpful for managers in making faster and more accurate decisions. The basic concept of the SAW method is to find the weighted sum of performance ratings in each alternative and on all attributes that require the decision matrix normalization process (X) to a scale that can be compared with all available alternative ratings.

7,"Spatial inequality of development is an important issue in Bangladesh. In this study a set of sectors-education, infrastructure, health, and economy-and sectoral components/indicators were selected aiming at investigating the spatial inequality scenario of Bangladesh. All components/indicators of each sector were weighted overlaid using ArcGIS tool. Finally, the overall spatial inequality of development was generated overlaying all the sectoral inequality maps. The spatial inequalities were revealed categorically from the highest overlaid cell value as the most lagged area to the lowest value as the most advance area. A serious centralized character towards the capital Dhaka was identified almost in all the sectors in spatial inequality maps of Bangladesh. The overall spatial inequality map identified a total of 16 districts in the comparatively ‘lagged area’ category; and 44 districts in the category of the ‘moderate area’. Only one district (the capital Dhaka) was identified in the category of ‘most advance area’, while three districts (Chittagong, Gazipur, Narayanganj) found in the ‘advance area’ category.

7,"This paper reports a comparison of different types of springs used in MEMS based capacitive accelerometers. In this work MEMS based Single-axis accelerometers are designed using different Suspension systems. Analysis of the structure is done for resonant frequency of 2kHz. Analytical modeling of the different suspensions is presented for the specified frequency. Stress, displacement and capacitive analysis of the accelerometer is done. The sensitivity of the accelerometer with parallel beam  suspension is 70nm/g, 50nm/g for folded beam suspension and 35nm/g for serpentine beam suspension. Hence parallel beam suspension has 0.7 times improved sensitivity than folded beam and 2 times better than serpentine suspension accelerometer. Whereas the stress obtained for folded beam is better than the other two. Hence  Parallel beam suspension is preferred for higher sensitivity and accuracy whereas Folded beam suspension is preferred for greater structural stability By comparing these devices, it is concluded that a compromise on certain parameters is required in order meet the requirements.

7,"The energy crisis is a severe problem facing the world, including Indonesia. Along with the times, innovation is needed to implement sustainable energy. Non-fossil energy sources have not been widely used, and efforts are still needed to utilize these energy sources. The waterwheel was the first device used in water production. One of the innovations for the sustainability of non-fossil energy is to make a waterwheel. There are still several waterwheels in Indonesia, but an investigation is needed to determine their condition. So in this study, investigating the breastshot water wheel uses a nozzle-based construction with variations in the degree of inclination of the spray against the TSR value. The results showed that the greater the inclination of the nozzle angle, the higher the velocity of the water flow when it enters the wheel. Adding water speed to this wheel will increase the momentum and tangential force. An increase in the tangential force will increase the wheel's torque so that the wheel strength will increase. This increase in power will, of course, result in greater efficiency, thereby increasing the tip speed ratio (TSR).",Experimental study of a breastshot waterwheel with the degree of inclination of the nozzle spray against the tip speed ratio,2023-03-30,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCE,experimental study of a breastshot waterwheel with the degree of inclination of the nozzle spray against the tip speed ratio the energy crisis is a severe problem facing the world including indonesia along with the times innovation is needed to implement sustainable energy nonfossil energy sources have not been widely used and efforts are still needed to utilize these energy sources the waterwheel was the first device used in water production one of the innovations for the sustainability of nonfossil energy is to make a waterwheel there are still several waterwheels in indonesia but an investigation is needed to determine their condition so in this study investigating the breastshot water wheel uses a nozzlebased construction with variations in the degree of inclination of the spray against the tsr value the results showed that the greater the inclination of the nozzle angle the higher the velocity of the water flow when it enters the wheel adding water speed to this wheel will increase the momentum and tangential force an increase in the tangential force will increase the wheels torque so that the wheel strength will increase this increase in power will of course result in greater efficiency thereby increasing the tip speed ratio tsr,20771223,7

7,"In this study, the multipurpose objective of development in the Anambra River basin was examined. The study's goals are to determine the net benefits of the various objectives under each purpose currently carried out by the Anambra River Basin, to identify the best way to achieve the goals, and to show, through logical and mathematical reasoning, how money could be allocated to the various goals of a dam project in Anambra State effectively. Economic Efficiency (EE), Regional Economic Redistribution (RER), Social Well-Being (SW), Youth Empowerment (YE), and Environmental Quality Improvement are the objectives taken into account in the study (EQI). The optimization problem in the multi-purpose-objective development of the Anambra State river basin was solved utilizing the multi-start optimization method. The study showed that the basin would achieve enormous financial benefits if it used its N15.0 billion strategic development budget over four years for various purposes as illustrated. The results showed that the following allocation of the five purposes should be optimized simultaneously for an N15.0 billion four-year strategic development fund: EE should receive N0.762 billion, RER should receive N0.594 billion, SW should receive N0.649 billion, YE should receive N0.683 billion, and environmental quality improvement should receive N4.768 billion.  It was found that Environmental Quality Improvement was allocated the higher amount while Regional Economic Redistribution was allocated the least amount for the development. The study's findings recommended that the management of the basin stop the practice of allocating funds to various uses at their discretion, which has led to significant oversight and the improper distribution of scarce resources. As a result, every fund distribution must be justified using logic and mathematics.

7,"Fuel use as a primary energy source is increasing daily, and the reserves of these natural resources are diminishing quickly. Different studies have been performed to see the potential use of the seeds of the Nyamplung plant (Chalophyllum inophyllum L.) as biodiesel. To produce biodiesel from Nyamplung oil, a catalyst, such as zeolite, is often required to speed up the reaction, save energy use, and increase the quantity and quality of the biodiesel. There is a high variation in terms of natural zeolite’s catalytic activity, depending on the location where the zeolite was formed in the past.

7,"Recovering ethanol solutions from filtration, extraction, and stripping operations is done in the distillation column, a separation process unit in the carboxymethyl cellulose production plant. Because the ethanol produced by these techniques is produced at a lower concentration, distillation is required to purify the ethanol. This procedure can raise the concentration of ethanol by separating it from the mixture. The concentration of the ethanol solution needs to be 85% in order to be reused. This case study aims to determine the optimal reflux ratio for a distillation column, model the process in both real-world and manual calculation scenarios using Aspen Hysys software, and evaluate the effects of increasing the reflux ratio. Manual computations yielded a reflux ratio result of 0.91814.

7,"The main stage of crude palm oil (CPO) production takes place in the boiling process, which involves the role of sterilizer equipment. One of the ideal standards for producing CPO is to have an oil yield value in the range of 22.5-23.5%. However, the palm oil processing industry only found an oil yield of 20.25%. The decrease in yield was due to the steam pressure entering the sterilizer not being up to standard. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of steam exiting the sterilizer or heat loss with the help of mathematical equations (including the Nusselt number and Rayleigh number) by utilizing field data. This research in the palm oil processing industry gave the highest result for heat loss at peak III of 58,074 kJ with Bunches of Fresh Fruit (BFF) boiling conditions at 2.7 bar and 130°C and a process time of 600 seconds. The resulting CPO oil yield was 20.25% (a decrease of about 10–14% from the production standard). The industry, together with a third party (a maintenance consultant from outside the company), assessed the need to maintain a continuous production process and a decrease in oil yield (2.25–3.25%). The yield gap leads to solving the problem through an operating condition optimization approach.
