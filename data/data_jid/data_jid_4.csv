The efficient and effective auditing system is one that be able to support the efficient and effective government in creating efficient bureaucracy and in developing the economy.

The SPKN draft uses a number of references from previous and existing auditing standards in the United States and that provided by the international institutions, which is appropriate for the efficiency of the process. However, the unique social, economic and regulatory situation of Indonesia should be considered in developing the govermental auditing standards for Indonesia. The transitional nature of laws and regulations such as those with regard to decentralization and autonomy, deregulations of certain industry, and privatization are too worthy for not to be considered. Auditing standards are fundamental guidelines for auditors to maintain their ethical values and to achieve the objectives of the auditing. The process should also refers to certain criteria for financial accountability i.e. generally accepted accounting standards.

In contrast, normativetheory have often argued for a change in accounting method withoutputting forward any supporting empirical evidence and without tryingto understand the rationale for the status quo. One criticism of normativeaccounting theory is that it makes certain prescriptions for accountingand auditing practice which are not based on identified and empiricalobservations. An appreciation of difference between positive and normative accounting&nbsp;theories is necessary for any understanding of accounting theory.&nbsp;This is especially so because positive accounting theory has been a&nbsp;strongly supported paradigm in accounting research during the past&nbsp;decade, but the relative importance of positivism and normativism in&nbsp;accounting has been keenly debated for at least 25 years.",TEORI AKUNTANSI: DARI PENDEKATAN NORMATIF KE POSITIF,2018-11-29,JURNAL BISNIS DAN AKUNTANSI,teori akuntansi dari pendekatan normatif ke positif recent attention in accounting has focused on developing a positive theory which a major force in academic accounting research for almost two decades the philosophical objective of positive accounting theory is to explain and predict current accounting practice positive theory seeks to understand why accounting practices are employedby accountantsin different circumtances and by different firms in contrast normativetheory have often argued for a change in accounting method withoutputting forward any supporting empirical evidence and without tryingto understand the rationale for the status quo one criticism of normativeaccounting theory is that it makes certain prescriptions for accountingand auditing practice which are not based on identified and empiricalobservations an appreciation of difference between positive and normative accountingtheories is necessary for any understanding of accounting theory this is especially so because positive accounting theory has been astrongly supported paradigm in accounting research during the pastdecade but the relative importance of positivism and normativism inaccounting has been keenly debated for at least  years,26569124,4

However, analytical studies dealingwith auditor independence issues (e.g. Magee and tseng, 1990; Dye,1991; Teoh, 1992) suggest an opposite causation, in which the auditor isless likely to qualify the opinion for a client who may switch auditors.&nbsp;Some evidence of an opposite causation is provided by Krishnan (1994) ,&nbsp;who finds that auditors treat switchers more conservatively in issuing&nbsp;the audit opinion.

Corporate governance adalah&nbsp;serangkaian mekanisme yang digunakan untuk membatasi timbulnya&nbsp;masalah keagenan (Ariyoto, 2000). Salah satu hal yang menyebabkan&nbsp;timbulnya masalah keagenan adalah adanya asimetri informasi antara agen&nbsp;dan prinsipal perusahaan.&nbsp;Di sisi lain, kemungkinan dilakukannya manajemen laba akan meningkat&nbsp;seiring dengan meningkatnya asimetri informasi (Dye ,1988 dan Trueman&nbsp;dan Titman (1988).

Penelitian ini berbeda dengan penelitian&nbsp;sebelumnya dalam hal pengukuran variabel corporate governance yang&nbsp;lebih komprehensif.

4,"The use of discretionary accruals for the purpose of income increasing or income decreasing has been examined widely. However,&nbsp;als for the purpose of income smoothing has not been accounting research. Most studies concerning income smoothing is on the&nbsp;factors that affect the probability the company to smooth income.&nbsp;The purpose of this study is to examine whether income smoother uses&nbsp;discretionary accruals to accomplish the purpose. Specifically, this study investigates whether the discretionary accruals&nbsp;are used when the company financial performance is good. The sample consists of 85 listed companies&nbsp;in the Jakarta Stock Exchange. The sample are not from service nor&nbsp;financial institutions, such as banks, insurance, and investment companies since they have different&nbsp;characteristics than the manufacturing. The data are taken from the year 1997 to 2001.&nbsp;The result shows that income smoothing does not correlate with the discretionary accruals. Therefore, the smoothers do not use discretionary accruals&nbsp;to achieve their purpose. Another result shows that smoothers who have good performance have lower discretionary accruals than those who do not have good performance. This result contradicts the logic that&nbsp;smoothers will have more discretionary accruals to achieve their purpose&nbsp;of income smoothing.

4,"Korupsi di Indonesia bagaikan penyakit yang mengerikan. Keberadaannya telah merusak seluruh sendi kehidupan, hingga menimbulkan krisis berkepanjangan. Namun kekuatan untuk menghentikannya tidaklah lebih besar dari daya pendorong timbulnya korupsi, karena korupsi telah merasuk dalam kehidupan sebagian besar masyarakat dari tingkatan yang paling bawah samapai elit politik. Oleh karena itu pada tataran makro, korupsi telah menjadi budaya masyarakat. Berangkat dari sinilah kajian korupsi banyak mengambil sisi etika, budaya dan moral. Sementar itu kurang memperhatikan kajian dari fenomena ekonomi. Kajian dari sisi ekonomi bukan untuk mengganti berbagai kajian seperti disebutkan di atas, namun bersifat melengkapi. Menurut penulis, adanya upah di bawah standar atau tidak&nbsp;comparable&nbsp; menimbulkan perasaan&nbsp;underpayment.&nbsp; Inilah salah satu landasan untuk melakukan korupsi. Korupsi menimbulkan biaya keagenan (agency cost)&nbsp;yang tidak dapat diperhitungkan besarnya. Dimana korupsi merupakan upaya mebcari keuntungan pribadi para pemegang kendali manajemen dengan beban ditanggung organisasi. Dalam kajian mikro, motif ekonomi dari individu lebih menonjol. Korupsi bukan budaya, melainkan kasus yang dilatarbelakangi ketidakadilan (inequity)&nbsp;yang tidak segera diselesaikan sampai sumbernya. Korupsi merupakan sebuah reaksi kompromistis dari adanya rasa&nbsp;inequity,&nbsp;karena tidak sanggup menolak ketidakadilan tersebut. Teori equity tampaknya dapat menjelaskan timbulnya korupsi tersebut.

4,"Proses audit atas laporan keuangan dilaksanakan oleh auditor melalui empat tahap utama yaitu: perencanaan, pemahaman, pengujian struktur pengendalian interen serta penerbitan laporan audit (Mulyadi dan Kanaka, 1998). Dalam membuat laporan audit seseorang auditor harus mempertimbangkan beberapa permasalahan yaitu materialitas, resiko dan judgment. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England dan Wales (1996) menyatakan suatu persoalan dikatakan materialitas jika tidak adanya pengungkapan atas salah saji material atau kelalaian dari suatu account dapat mengubah pandangan yang diberikan terhadap laporan keuangan. Materialitas berhubungan dengan judgment, ketika dikaitkan dengan cara evaluasi resiko pertimbangan inilah yang akan mempengaruhi cara-cara pencapaian tujuan audit, ruang lingkup dan arah pekerjaan terperinci serta disposisi kesalahan dan kelalaian (Taylor, 2000). Sedangkan resiko menunjukkan tingkat resiko kegagalan auditor untuk mengubah pendapat atas laporan keuangan yang sebenarnya berisis salah saji material.

4,"Fenomena yang selalu terjadi berulang secara tahunan atas komoditi semen Indonesia adalah sering hilangnya produk ini di pasar yang disusul dengan naik harga. Kendatipun alasan klasik yang sering dikemukakan adalah karena pengaruh musim dan kenaikan biaya produksi akibat penyesuaian harga BBM dan listrik, namun tetap saja tersimoan suatu pertanyaan. Adakah suatu penyebab, yang sesungguhnya adalah akar dari persoalan tersebut? Dengan maksud untuk menjawab pertanyaan tersebut, penelitian ini dilakukan. Pendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Ekonomi Industri. Dengan menggunakan alat analisis&nbsp;Concentration Ratio (CR4) dan Indeks Linda, penelitian ini diarahkan untuk mengungkap tiga aspek utama dalam industri semen, yakni struktur (structure),&nbsp;perilaku (conduct),&nbsp; dan kinerja (performance).&nbsp;Sedangkan data yang digunakan adalah informasi tentang pangsa pasar perusahaan-perusahaan semen yang ada dalam pasar semen Indonesia dalam kurun waktu 1998-2001. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa struktur pasar industri semen Indonesia bercorak oligopoli. Hal ini ditunjukkan dengan sedikitnya perusahaan yang beroperasi dalam pasar sebagai pemain utama (5-7 perusahaan). Corak pasar yang demikian semakin nyata dengan temuan tingkat konsentrasi empat perusahaan dengan pangsa terbesar (CR4) yang berkisar antara 75-85 persen. Mencermati perkembangan jumlah perusahaan yang beroperasi sebagai pemain utama dan angka rasio konsentrasi, ditemukan pula bahwa tingkat persaingan dalam pasar industri ini semakintidak kompetitif. Struktur pasar seperti dijelaskan di atas pada kenyataannya telah mendorong perusahaan-perusahaan semen untuk melakukan kartel di antara mereka melalui Asosiasi Semen Indonesia (ASI). Dengan kartel ini selanjutnya mereka melakukan pengaturan tingkat produksi dan pada gilirannya hal yang sama dilakukan pula terhadap harga. Maka tak mengherankan jika harga semen selalu meningkat meskipun penetapan harga ini ditentukan oleh pemerintah. Disisi lain, kenaikan harga ini juga dipicu oleh tingkat produksi perusahaan semen yang masih di bawah kapasitas produksinya. Struktur, perilaku dan kinerja pasar industri semen seperti di atas pada kenyataanya juga telah menjadi hambatan masuk (barrier to entry)&nbsp;bagi calon-calon perusahaan semen baru untuk beroperasi ke dalam pasar semen Indonesia.",OLIGOPOLI DAN KARTEL PADA INDUSTRI SEMEN INDONESIA: 1998-2001,2019-11-06,JURNAL BISNIS DAN AKUNTANSI,oligopoli dan kartel pada industri semen indonesia  fenomena yang selalu terjadi berulang secara tahunan atas komoditi semen indonesia adalah sering hilangnya produk ini di pasar yang disusul dengan naik harga kendatipun alasan klasik yang sering dikemukakan adalah karena pengaruh musim dan kenaikan biaya produksi akibat penyesuaian harga bbm dan listrik namun tetap saja tersimoan suatu pertanyaan adakah suatu penyebab yang sesungguhnya adalah akar dari persoalan tersebut dengan maksud untuk menjawab pertanyaan tersebut penelitian ini dilakukan pendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah ekonomi industri dengan menggunakan alat analisisconcentration ratio cr dan indeks linda penelitian ini diarahkan untuk mengungkap tiga aspek utama dalam industri semen yakni struktur structureperilaku conduct dan kinerja performance sedangkan data yang digunakan adalah informasi tentang pangsa pasar perusahaanperusahaan semen yang ada dalam pasar semen indonesia dalam kurun waktu  hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa struktur pasar industri semen indonesia bercorak oligopoli hal ini ditunjukkan dengan sedikitnya perusahaan yang beroperasi dalam pasar sebagai pemain utama  perusahaan corak pasar yang demikian semakin nyata dengan temuan tingkat konsentrasi empat perusahaan dengan pangsa terbesar cr yang berkisar antara  persen mencermati perkembangan jumlah perusahaan yang beroperasi sebagai pemain utama dan angka rasio konsentrasi ditemukan pula bahwa tingkat persaingan dalam pasar industri ini semakintidak kompetitif struktur pasar seperti dijelaskan di atas pada kenyataannya telah mendorong perusahaanperusahaan semen untuk melakukan kartel di antara mereka melalui asosiasi semen indonesia asi dengan kartel ini selanjutnya mereka melakukan pengaturan tingkat produksi dan pada gilirannya hal yang sama dilakukan pula terhadap harga maka tak mengherankan jika harga semen selalu meningkat meskipun penetapan harga ini ditentukan oleh pemerintah disisi lain kenaikan harga ini juga dipicu oleh tingkat produksi perusahaan semen yang masih di bawah kapasitas produksinya struktur perilaku dan kinerja pasar industri semen seperti di atas pada kenyataanya juga telah menjadi hambatan masuk barrier to entrybagi caloncalon perusahaan semen baru untuk beroperasi ke dalam pasar semen indonesia,26569124,4

4,"This study examines the accuracy of capability of companies to survive during the Indonesia monetary crisis in 1997-1999. Several studies have developed models to predict the bankcrupty of firms and found that some financial ratios are useful in predicting the possibility of bankcrupty. This study uses those ratios that have been proved useful in predicting bankcruptcy to predict the survival of Indonesian companies during the crisis. in addition, this study also uses human prediction. Research on comparing human prediction and statistics methods in the auditing areas have found that human is superior in prediction because human possesses human information processing which consider other data (besides financial data) in prediction. The results show taht human prediction is inferior in predicting companies' capability to survive the crisis and work experience affects the accuracy of the human judgment prediction. However, the study also shows that some ratios that are preferably used by human in predicting are consistent with the ratios used in previous studies.

4,"Historically, it was believed that dual role (i.e. the individual as professional and also involve in managerial role) can potentially have adverse consequences through the creation of role conflict. Comerford and Abernethy’s (1999) finding revealed that the individuals with a high professional orientation will experience less adverse consequences (i.e. lower role conflict) when involved in the budgeting process provided that they have taken on a system goal orientation. As such, this field study reexamines this professional-managerial role conflict with the different subject. Besides, this study is extended by looking at the moderating effect of perceived fairness on the relationship between professional orientation and role conflict. The result of this study was not consistent with those indicated by prior empirical research which showed that goal system orientation had a direct effect on the relationship between professional orientation and role conflict. This finding, however, support the contemporary perspective, which suggest that occupational commitment and organizational commitment are positively, not negatively associated. The other finding of this field study does not enable rejection of the second null hypothesis for the sample group with lower participation level.

Pada awalnya pengembangan teori akuntansi didasarkan pada praktek. Seiring dengan perkembangan tuntutan bisnis terhadap akuntansi, selanjutnya teori akuntansi dikembangkan dengan pendekatan normative descriptive. Pendekatan terakhir tersebut banyak dinilai tidak ilmiah, kemudian teori akuntansi dikembangkan dengan mendasarkan diri pada teori akuntansi positif. Aliran positif telah banyak mendapatkan kritik, diantaranya positivisme telah menyebabkan ilmu berkembang dengan pesat sampai melupakan induk filsafatnya serta aliran positif dianggap memaksakan kehendak peneliti dengan merekayasa data agar normal. Mulailah berkembang paham critical yang telah menekankan pada kebebasan metodologi dan sejarah untuk mendapatkan teori yang holistik, tetapi baru diakui positivism telah terbukti mampu mengembangkan ilmu dan tehnologi seperti yang ada pada saat ini. Dengan demikian paham critical tepat sebagai pembanding dan pelengkap paham positivisme (Hadi, 1999). Hubungan antara filsafat, ilmu ekonomi, dan akuntansi didasarkan pada masalah yang dihadapi dalam pengembangan teori akuntansi yaitu berbagai konsep atau pengertian lain yang diambil dari mainstream teori akuntansi, sementara banyak teoritisi akuntansi pada awalnya memiliki pengetahuan ilmu ekonomi seperti, Devine (1961) dan Chambers (1977).

4,"This research examines cross-quarter differences in the response of stock prices to earnings announcements. The research focuses on whether fourth quarter earnings announcements contain more or less information than those of interim quarters. Like many prior studies, this paper provides information about regressions of unexpected announcement period returns on measure of unexpected earnings. It conducted with three different measures of measures of unexpected earnings; earnings expectations are based on seasonal random walk, random walk with trend and market-adjusted trend. Using 45 firms and 720 quarterly earnings for period 1996 through 1999 with weighted last square, this paper present evidence that stock prices respond less to fourth quarter earnings announcements that to intern announcements. Fourth quarter announcement are characterized by a smaller ERC (Mandenhall and Nichols,1988; Salamon and Stober, 1994 and Lee and Park, 2000) and a lower explanatory power of unexpected earnings than earlier quarter announcements (Hagerman, Zmijewski and Shah, 1984) because of lower predictability of fourth quarter earnings (Collins, Hopwood and McKeown, 1984). This results suggests that fourth quarter earnings are less persistent and less useful to investors than interim quarter earnings. Two explanations from previous studies are the existence of fiscal year-and discretionary accruals from earnings management or the phenomenon of fourth quarter settling up described by Collins, Hopwood and McKeown (1984). In addition, measurement error in earning expectations may be larger in fourth quarters than in interim quarters (Salamon and Stober,1994)",ANALISIS RESPON HARGA SAHAM TERHADAP PENGUMUMAN LABA KUARTAL INTERIM DAN KUARTAL KEEMPAT,2019-11-07,JURNAL BISNIS DAN AKUNTANSI,analisis respon harga saham terhadap pengumuman laba kuartal interim dan kuartal keempat this research examines crossquarter differences in the response of stock prices to earnings announcements the research focuses on whether fourth quarter earnings announcements contain more or less information than those of interim quarters like many prior studies this paper provides information about regressions of unexpected announcement period returns on measure of unexpected earnings it conducted with three different measures of measures of unexpected earnings earnings expectations are based on seasonal random walk random walk with trend and marketadjusted trend using  firms and  quarterly earnings for period  through  with weighted last square this paper present evidence that stock prices respond less to fourth quarter earnings announcements that to intern announcements fourth quarter announcement are characterized by a smaller erc mandenhall and nichols salamon and stober  and lee and park  and a lower explanatory power of unexpected earnings than earlier quarter announcements hagerman zmijewski and shah  because of lower predictability of fourth quarter earnings collins hopwood and mckeown  this results suggests that fourth quarter earnings are less persistent and less useful to investors than interim quarter earnings two explanations from previous studies are the existence of fiscal yearand discretionary accruals from earnings management or the phenomenon of fourth quarter settling up described by collins hopwood and mckeown  in addition measurement error in earning expectations may be larger in fourth quarters than in interim quarters salamon and stober,26569124,4

Most studies focus on the consequences rather than the antecedents of participative budgeting. We also learn from reviewing the extant theories on participative budgeting that empirical studies on the relationship between participative budgeting and job performance and job satisfaction use a procedural justice concept as the underlying theory. Since the procedural justice, viewed from psychological standpoint, is one of the antecedents to participative budgeting, we posit that the inconsistent findings aforementioned are caused by lack of attention to the antecedents of budgetary participation. Different cultures among nations may also cause different effects of participation.

4,"Sejumlah literatur akuntansi menyatakan bahwa hakikat akuntansi sebagai suatu ilmu dapat didekati dari sudut pandang filsafat ilmu (philosophy of science). Dinyatakan bahwa peran filsafat ilmu sebagai fondasi dalam pengembangan akuntansi sangat besar. Tulisan ini bertujuan untuk menelaah kontribusi filsafat ilmu sebagai fondasi pengembangan ilmu akuntansi dari waktu ke waktu. Secara khusus, telaah difokuskan pada tiga aspek utama filsafat ilmu, yaitu aspek aksiologi, epistemology dan ontologi. Selain tiga aspek tersebut, aspek etik dan heuristik juga ditelaah. Hasil telaah menunjukkan bahwa filsafat ilmu berperan penting sebagai fondasi utama dalam pengembangan dan ekstensi ilmu (teori) akuntansi. Dari aspek Ontologis, filsafat ilmu berperan sebagai fondasi utama dalam perumusan postulat-postulat atau asumsi-asumsi dasar akuntansi. Dari aspek epistemologis, filsafat ilmu berperan krusial sebagai fondasi utama dalam penentuan dan perumusan exemplar atau obyek pengetahuan, gambaran (images) pokok persoalan, teori-teori, metode-metode, prinsip-prinsip, standar-standar dan instrument-instrumen akuntansi. Dari aspek aksiologis, filsafat ilmu berperan penting untuk mengarahkan tujuan (goals) dan sasaran (objectives) akhir dari proses pengembangan ilmu akuntansi untuk pihak-pihak yang berkepentingan. Dari aspek etik, filsafat ilmu juga berperan sebagai fondasi utama dalam memberikan aspek-aspek etik dan moral dalam pengembangan norma-norma dan kode etik praktik dan pemeriksaan akuntansi, serta pengungkapan dan pertanggungjawaban informasi akuntansi. Dari aspek heuristik, filsafat ilmu berperan sebagai fondasi bagi para teoritikus akuntansi untuk mempertimbangkan dan mengadopsi sejunlah paradigma dari disiplin ilmu-ilmu lain untuk menjawab berbagai kompleksitas masalah yang sedang dan akan dihadapi akuntansi dewasa ini. Singkatnya, filsafat ilmu berperan sebagai fondasi utama dalam mendorong akuntansi sebagai a multiparadigmatic science (Belkaoui 1996 dan 2000).",PERAN FILSAFAT ILMU SEBAGAI FONDASI UTAMA DALAM PENGEMBANGAN ILMU (TEORI) AKUNTANSI,2019-11-07,JURNAL BISNIS DAN AKUNTANSI,peran filsafat ilmu sebagai fondasi utama dalam pengembangan ilmu teori akuntansi sejumlah literatur akuntansi menyatakan bahwa hakikat akuntansi sebagai suatu ilmu dapat didekati dari sudut pandang filsafat ilmu philosophy of science dinyatakan bahwa peran filsafat ilmu sebagai fondasi dalam pengembangan akuntansi sangat besar tulisan ini bertujuan untuk menelaah kontribusi filsafat ilmu sebagai fondasi pengembangan ilmu akuntansi dari waktu ke waktu secara khusus telaah difokuskan pada tiga aspek utama filsafat ilmu yaitu aspek aksiologi epistemology dan ontologi selain tiga aspek tersebut aspek etik dan heuristik juga ditelaah hasil telaah menunjukkan bahwa filsafat ilmu berperan penting sebagai fondasi utama dalam pengembangan dan ekstensi ilmu teori akuntansi dari aspek ontologis filsafat ilmu berperan sebagai fondasi utama dalam perumusan postulatpostulat atau asumsiasumsi dasar akuntansi dari aspek epistemologis filsafat ilmu berperan krusial sebagai fondasi utama dalam penentuan dan perumusan exemplar atau obyek pengetahuan gambaran images pokok persoalan teoriteori metodemetode prinsipprinsip standarstandar dan instrumentinstrumen akuntansi dari aspek aksiologis filsafat ilmu berperan penting untuk mengarahkan tujuan goals dan sasaran objectives akhir dari proses pengembangan ilmu akuntansi untuk pihakpihak yang berkepentingan dari aspek etik filsafat ilmu juga berperan sebagai fondasi utama dalam memberikan aspekaspek etik dan moral dalam pengembangan normanorma dan kode etik praktik dan pemeriksaan akuntansi serta pengungkapan dan pertanggungjawaban informasi akuntansi dari aspek heuristik filsafat ilmu berperan sebagai fondasi bagi para teoritikus akuntansi untuk mempertimbangkan dan mengadopsi sejunlah paradigma dari disiplin ilmuilmu lain untuk menjawab berbagai kompleksitas masalah yang sedang dan akan dihadapi akuntansi dewasa ini singkatnya filsafat ilmu berperan sebagai fondasi utama dalam mendorong akuntansi sebagai a multiparadigmatic science belkaoui  dan ,26569124,4

Pengembangan model pada penelitian menempatkan variabel prakualifikasi penjamin emisi sebagai veriabel intervening dalam kaitan hubungan antara emiten dengan investor pada peristiwa penawaran umum perdana. Hubungan antara emiten dengan penjamin emisi dalam proses penawaran umum perdana dapat menciptakan asimetri informasi. Adanya asimetri informasi lebih lanjut akan merugikan para investor. Para investor memerlukan adanya assurance bahwa harga saham di pasar sekunder sesudah listing, tidak jatuh lebih rendah dari harga belinya di pasar perdana. Studi ini dilakukan di Bursa Efek Jakarta (BEJ) pada 108 perusahaan yang telah menyelengggarakan proses Penawaran umum Perdana dalam kurun waktu 1997-2002. Untuk analisis digunakan motode Stuctural Equation Modelling (SEM) untuk klepentingan menganalisis hubungan variabel secara langsung dan tidak langsung. Penelitian ini mencoba mengungkapkan pengaruh dari variabel assurance berupa umur perusahaan dan ukuran perusahaan tehadap prakualifikasi penjamin emisi dan return awal saham paska penawaran umum perdana. Variabel ukuran perusahaan melalui prakualifikasi penjamin emisi berpengaruh secara signifikan terhadap tingkat kembalian awal saham paska penawaran umum perdana. Semakin besar perusahaan berarti ketidakpastiannya semakin rendah dan returnnya juga semakin relatif rendah dan demikian sebaliknya. Variabel umur perusahaan melalui prakualifikasi penjamin emisi berpengaruh secara signifikan terhadap tingkat kembalian awal saham paska penawaran umum perdana. Semakin panjang umur perusahaan berarti semakin berpengalaman mengantisipasi kemungkinan yang terjadi. Implikasinya bagi perusahaan yang belum berumur perlu bersinergi dengan perusahaan yang sudah berumur tatkala akan bermaksud menyelenggarakan IPO. Hasil penelitian ini dapat merumuskan dan membuktikan bahwa variabel umur perusahan dan ukuran perusahaan merupakan variabel signaling kategori tidak langsung. Variabel tersebut baru merupakan signal yang nyata pengaruhnya ketika melalui prakualifikasi penjamin emisi sebagai variabel intervening atau baru menjadi signifikan sewaktu dikaitkan pengaruhnya terhadap prakualifikasi penjamin emisi dan tingkat kembalain awal saham paska penawarn umum perdana. Berdasarkan hasil uji analisis faktor, maka variabel umur perusahaan dan variabel umur perusahaan dan variabel ukuran perusahaan dinyatakan memenuhi syarat sebagai indikator dari variabel assurance. Upaya assurance yang dilakukan oleh emiten melalui prakualifikasi penjamin emisi berpengaruh signifikan terhadap return awal paska penawaran umum perdana. Dengan demikian penelitian ini dapat merumuskan dan membuktikan bahwa sebagai intervening variabel, prakualifikasi penjamin emisi terbukti berperan positip mengurangi tejadinya asimetri informasi dengan cara menjembatani dan memperkuat assurance perusahaan pada pasar. Pada paska penawaran umum perdana return awal saham yang tercipta dalam jangka pendek terbukti lebih besar dari return jangka panjang (satu tahun) sesudah penawaran umum perdana.

Among the sector of employment, the highest male female earnings differential was reported in agriculture sector and the lowest in formal job status.

4,"The paper discusses previous studies on the effect of fatigue among flight crews and their effect on airline businesses. Fatigue is a major concern in flight operations as many reports were issued on this problem among flight crew. The long flight duration requires them to travel several time zones, which leads to fatigue. Furthermore, the change of time zones could also lead to the occurrence of jet lag and subsequently causes fatigue too. Fatigue can occur during and after the travelling period, and it takes a while to recover from it. This study aims to observe the effects of fatigue experienced by flight crew. The results show that fatigue causes many health problems such as an increase in cancer risk, depression, mental illness and miscarriage. Additionally, fatigue reduces one's work productivity as working in a tired state reduces work performance. Furthermore, fatigue also leads to other problems such as anger, anxiety, stress and job dissatisfaction.

4,"This study investigates the effect of the board of directors (BOD) diversity on dividend policy and how the implications of profitability are treated as moderation. Dividend policy and BOD characteristics have been studied extensively; however, the profitability role being moderating variable and BOD diversity are challenging. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first to examine profitability as moderation. BOD diversity includes gender, age, education level, accounting expertise, and nationality. The research period spanned 2017-2020, where the number of samples was 370 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, resulting in 1,480 data. The regression model used is panel data. Overall, BOD gender, education level, and nationality are homogeneous, where female directors, directors with master's education, and foreign directors have a small proportion. As a result, they have no significant effect in promoting dividends. In addition, profitability cannot influence the relationship between board gender and board nationality on dividends. Nevertheless, profitability moderates the relationship between board nationality and dividend policy to a significant negative. Further, board age and accounting expertise positively and significantly affect dividend policy, and the results are identical when moderated by profitability. The proportion of board expertise expressed is heterogeneous, and the board age of 52 years is categorized as old, while they mitigate agency conflict. Thus, companies are required to maintain these proportions. However, companies must remedy the recruitment system to accommodate more female directors, directors with higher education at the master's level, and foreign directors. The government must also refer to regulations in developed and developing countries that establish a minimum quota for the presence of female directors.",Can Board Diversity Promote Dividend Policy?

4,"This paper examines the relationship between financial performance and Annual Readability Reporting. This study is interesting in that companies should submit reports concisely and are easy to read. However, it turns out that many company managers submit management reports in many sentences, especially when financial performance is not in good condition. An interesting finding of this paper is that net income has a significant negative effect on ARR, which indicates that even when management earns profits, the language of reporting submissions by management is quite difficult for users of financial statements to read. This study uses 66 years of observation of companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and tests the hypothesis using multiple linear regression and correlation. The results show that companies with high ARR with higher financial performance. Service companies in Indonesia need to convey their performance using more words, especially when financial conditions are not good. As measured by ROA, excellent financial performance significantly influences the readability of annual financial statements. The implications of this research are mainly for the service sector, there is a management behavior that has a habit of saying more words even though the profit is positive.

4,"This research departs from the problem of adopting and implementing modern accounting, which can potentially eliminate local wisdom values from accounting practices. This study aims to find the values of local wisdom behind the practice of education cost accounting by scholarship recipient students. This research uses the Islamic paradigm. The approach used is Islamic ethnomethodology. There are five data analysis stages: charity, knowledge, faith, revelation information, and courtesy. The study results found that students used funds from the government to finance educational needs for one semester. Funds sourced from parents are used by students, one of which is to give alms and help to human beings.

4,"Working capital decisions are important for financing the operations of manufacturing companies, especially during a pandemic which indicates a decline in working capital. This study aims to examine the effect of working capital (Net Working Capital - NWC) on the profitability of manufacturing companies on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) during non-pandemic and pandemic conditions covid-19, as well as testing the moderating effect of financial constraint. The sample is determined by technique purposive sampling for manufacturing companies from 2018-2021 and analyzed with moderation regression. Results do not confirm Resource-Based Theory where working capital has a significant negative effect on profitability because high working capital creates additional costs that can reduce profits. In addition, the data shows that each sub-sector has different characteristics in terms of working capital requirements and profit-generating capabilities. There are sub-sectors with low (high) working capital that have high (low) profitability. This negative direction of working capital and profits continued until the pandemic conditions, of course, several sub-sectors experienced a decline in profitability. This study also shows that there is no moderating effect financial constraint, but financial constraint has a significant positive effect on profitability. The lower financial constraint, the company's profits continued to decline which could be due to the company's less than optimal management of available funds. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are unconfirmed Resource-Based Theory due to differences in sub-sector and company characteristics.

4,"E-commerce has profoundly altered the shopping behaviors of consumers in Indonesia. Additionally, fintech companies have introduced ""paylater"" services, revolutionizing the payment process for online purchases. Paylater operates on a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) system, allowing consumers to make purchases and defer payment. This innovation enhances the ease and security of online shopping, enticing users with enticing sales promotions. A survey targeting e-commerce users in Indonesia was conducted and subsequently analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM - PLS). Employing a quantitative descriptive approach with a cross-sectional design, data was collected offline over 14 days in DKI Jakarta, Indonesia, yielding a final dataset from 122 respondents out of 210 obtained. Research outcomes revealed that sales promotion, subjective norms, and e-commerce live streaming features significantly influence impulsive buying behavior among consumers. The use of paylater services moderates this relationship, indicating that frequent paylater users tend to exhibit more impulsivity in their purchasing patterns. Despite the convenience offered by paylater services, there are associated risks such as debt accumulation and financial mismanagement. The findings of this research can serve as an educational tool for potential paylater users, encouraging responsible use and financial management. This research substantially contributes to the growth of fintech companies and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), ultimately fostering economic development and providing a reference for future researchers exploring similar topics.","SALES PROMOTION, LIVE STREAMING, SUBJECTIVE NORM TERHADAP IMPULSIVE BUYING DENGAN PAYLATER SEBAGAI VARIABEL MODERASI",2023-12-27,JURNAL BISNIS DAN AKUNTANSI,sales promotion live streaming subjective norm terhadap impulsive buying dengan paylater sebagai variabel moderasi ecommerce has profoundly altered the shopping behaviors of consumers in indonesia additionally fintech companies have introduced paylater services revolutionizing the payment process for online purchases paylater operates on a buy now pay later bnpl system allowing consumers to make purchases and defer payment this innovation enhances the ease and security of online shopping enticing users with enticing sales promotions a survey targeting ecommerce users in indonesia was conducted and subsequently analyzed using structural equation modeling sem  pls employing a quantitative descriptive approach with a crosssectional design data was collected offline over  days in dki jakarta indonesia yielding a final dataset from  respondents out of  obtained research outcomes revealed that sales promotion subjective norms and ecommerce live streaming features significantly influence impulsive buying behavior among consumers the use of paylater services moderates this relationship indicating that frequent paylater users tend to exhibit more impulsivity in their purchasing patterns despite the convenience offered by paylater services there are associated risks such as debt accumulation and financial mismanagement the findings of this research can serve as an educational tool for potential paylater users encouraging responsible use and financial management this research substantially contributes to the growth of fintech companies and micro small and mediumsized enterprises msmes ultimately fostering economic development and providing a reference for future researchers exploring similar topics,26569124,4
