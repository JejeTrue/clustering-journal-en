11,"Wayang Orang (the stage show usually with the wayang theme) is a performing art of which the characters are played by people. As a specific Sasak performing art, the wayang orang which is performed in Mataram Lombok, used to use what is referred to as Serat Menak as the story source. However, such a performing art was marginalized and was almost getting extinct. Therefore, the Sasak artists and cultural observers, whom were facilitated by UPTD Taman Budaya Lombok, did their best to save such a performing art by reconstructing it. The performing art which was constructed by IPTD Taman Budaya Lombok was the Wayang Orang Darma Kerti, Dusun Batu Pandang. Such a reconstruction was made in the middle of the struggle for an identity of those living in Mataram, Lombok, who belong to different ethnic groups and religions. This present study was intended to understand the matter pertaining to the reconstruction of Wayang Orang Darma Kerti as part of the struggle for the identity of the people living in Mataram, Lombok. The qualitative method and the theories of deconstruction, multiculturalism, and hegemony were used to analyze the problems of the study. The result of the study showed that 1) there was a desire to preserve Wayang Orang as a local identity, meaning that the desire to reconstruct it was inspired by the Islamic religious value and the Wetu Telu Islamic value; 2) it was reconstructed through several stages; they are observation, inventory, and classification; finally, it was decided to reconstruct Wayang Orang performed at Dusun Batu Pandang, East Lombok in which the puppeteers and dancers from Mataram, West Lombok, were involved; the puppeteers were gathered, the themes were composed, the performance was practiced, and the Wayang Orang was performed; 3)  the implication of the reconstruction of the Wayang Orang was that the Sasak ethnic group had an art identity, and religion and culture adapted to each other as the implementation of what is referred to as adatluwirgama, and the local people’s prosperity became better.","RECONSTRUCTION OF WAYANG ORANG DARMA KERTI AT BATU PANDANG: A STRUGGLE FOR IDENTITY IN MATARAM, LOMBOK",2016-08-01,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,reconstruction of wayang orang darma kerti at batu pandang a struggle for identity in mataram lombok wayang orang the stage show usually with the wayang theme is a performing art of which the characters are played by people as a specific sasak performing art the wayang orang which is performed in mataram lombok used to use what is referred to as serat menak as the story source however such a performing art was marginalized and was almost getting extinct therefore the sasak artists and cultural observers whom were facilitated by uptd taman budaya lombok did their best to save such a performing art by reconstructing it the performing art which was constructed by iptd taman budaya lombok was the wayang orang darma kerti dusun batu pandang such a reconstruction was made in the middle of the struggle for an identity of those living in mataram lombok who belong to different ethnic groups and religions this present study was intended to understand the matter pertaining to the reconstruction of wayang orang darma kerti as part of the struggle for the identity of the people living in mataram lombok the qualitative method and the theories of deconstruction multiculturalism and hegemony were used to analyze the problems of the study the result of the study showed that  there was a desire to preserve wayang orang as a local identity meaning that the desire to reconstruct it was inspired by the islamic religious value and the wetu telu islamic value  it was reconstructed through several stages they are observation inventory and classification finally it was decided to reconstruct wayang orang performed at dusun batu pandang east lombok in which the puppeteers and dancers from mataram west lombok were involved the puppeteers were gathered the themes were composed the performance was practiced and the wayang orang was performed  the implication of the reconstruction of the wayang orang was that the sasak ethnic group had an art identity and religion and culture adapted to each other as the implementation of what is referred to as adatluwirgama and the local peoples prosperity became better,23382449,11

11,"A change is occurring to the Sasak gandrung  performing art performed at Dasan Tereng Village, Narmada District, West Lombok District, West Nuasa Tenggara. The development of the understanding of Islam among the Sasak ethnic people has widely affected the development of such a performing art. The marginalization of the Sasak gandrung performing art cannot be separated from the limited protection given by the government, the strengthening of the religious fundamentalism, and the decrease in the supporting community’s self-confidence.  This present study is intended to identify one of the three phenomena of the marginalization of the gandrung Sasak performing art, especially the strengthening of the religious fundamentalism of the waktu lima Islam. The data were collected through observation, interview, and documents which are related to the gandrung Sasak. The data were analyzed qualitatively using the Theory of Social Practice proposed by Pierre Bourdieu. The results of the study show that the strengthening of the religious fundamentalism of waktu lima Islam caused the wetu telu Muslims to convert into waktu lima Muslims.

11,"This study was intended to present the matters pertaining to the attempts made by the vendors ‘pedagang acung’ to keep being independent in tourism sector in Bali. As working people with extremely limited capitals, the principle of giving priority to safety is applicable to them. They sell souvenirs with limited capitals obtained from various souvenir entrepreneurs coming from different parts of Bali. The risk of suffering from loss has never caused them to find any difficulty. This qualitative study was conducted in the paradigm of cultural studies. The data were presented and interpreted in the form of narrative texts which are thick descriptive in nature.   The result of the study showed that working as vendors was still a profession which contributed to the decrease in unemployment in an area. This is in line with the concept of poststructuralism that people are basically referred to as homo faber, namely, the working creature, meaning that working is highly important to man. This means that employment does not only give the opportunity to generate income but also importantly means that employment is a personal identity. As a consequence, if working is different from not working or being jobless, then such a choice does not only lead to an opposing binary but also to a hierarchical social division and a structured social gap between those who are employed and those who are not.

In relation to travelling, travelling done by women is examined, especially thelandlady’s environment, as there is a relationship between the host and the guest. The researchproblems are (1) how is reflection of tourism in the travelling women portrayed on the novels ofDaisy Miller, A Passage to India, and Pada Sebuah Kapal?. (2) How are motivating andattracting factors related to tourism as reflected in the travelling women articulated on the novelsof Daisy Miller, A Passage to India, and Pada Sebuah Kapal?. (3) How do cultural barriersoccur in tourism as reflected in the travelling women on Daisy Miller, a Passage to India, andPada Sebuah Kapal novel? In general, this research is to find out the comparison of travellingdone by women. Specifically, it is to discover the reflection of tourism, how the motivating andattracting factors and cultural barriers occur in tourism as reflected in the travelling done bywomen.This research is conducted on three novels, Daisy Miller written by Henry James, APassage To India by E.M. Forster, and Pada Sebuah Kapal by NH. Dini called comparativeliterature showing the continents of America, Europe and Asia. Discussing the three continents,this research is called global literature. Hermeneutic method was used to interpret the content ofthose three novels by employing deconstruction, postcolonial and feminism theories. The maindata were taken from those novels and the location of the research was both at private librariesand state libraries or institutions and websites. To support the main data, secondary data werealso needed, which in this case, were obtained by interviewing the women who have travelledabroad. Then the results were formally and informally presented.The findings show that the reflection of tourism in travelling done by women is representedby family companion, and that the means of transportation to their destinations are indigenousmeans of transportation and that the tourist objects visited are art metamorphosis, travel hyperreality,sacred places and natural and human recreational places. The factors motive ting thewomen to travel are inter personal, cultural, status and prestige. The things making theminterested in travelling are: the Castle of Chillon in Switzerland and the regions’s history, theevening party in Italy as a tradition to welcome new people, the architectures of Caesars’Palaces, the Coliseum and Chandrapore club as a tradition to welcome new people, the bridge party to know the language spoken and dress worn – traditional costumes of India, Koyasan asBuddhist religion and Paris as the centre of dress model. Cultural barriers refer to differentetiquettes, ideologies and moral values resulting in different ways of travelling and theirsolutions.Knowing the culture of the destination that is going to be visited is really needed, at least inorder not to know nothing at all about such a destination; furthermore, it reduces culturalbarriers. That is why cross cultural understanding is really necessarily given not only to thedoers of tourism but also to all institutions in order to reduce misunderstanding and increaseappreciation towards each other.","TOURISM AS REFLECTED IN TRAVELLING WOMEN: A COMPARATIVE CULTURAL STUDY ON THE NOVELS OF DAISY MILLER, A PASSAGE TO INDIA, AND PADA SEBUAH KAPAL",2012-11-26,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,tourism as reflected in travelling women a comparative cultural study on the novels of daisy miller a passage to india and pada sebuah kapal travelling has occurred since a long time ago travelling is not only done by men butalso by women in relation to travelling travelling done by women is examined especially thelandladys environment as there is a relationship between the host and the guest the researchproblems are  how is reflection of tourism in the travelling women portrayed on the novels ofdaisy miller a passage to india and pada sebuah kapal  how are motivating andattracting factors related to tourism as reflected in the travelling women articulated on the novelsof daisy miller a passage to india and pada sebuah kapal  how do cultural barriersoccur in tourism as reflected in the travelling women on daisy miller a passage to india andpada sebuah kapal novel in general this research is to find out the comparison of travellingdone by women specifically it is to discover the reflection of tourism how the motivating andattracting factors and cultural barriers occur in tourism as reflected in the travelling done bywomen this research is conducted on three novels daisy miller written by henry james apassage to india by e m forster and pada sebuah kapal by nh dini called comparativeliterature showing the continents of america europe and asia discussing the three continentsthis research is called global literature hermeneutic method was used to interpret the content ofthose three novels by employing deconstruction postcolonial and feminism theories the maindata were taken from those novels and the location of the research was both at private librariesand state libraries or institutions and websites to support the main data secondary data werealso needed which in this case were obtained by interviewing the women who have travelledabroad then the results were formally and informally presented the findings show that the reflection of tourism in travelling done by women is representedby family companion and that the means of transportation to their destinations are indigenousmeans of transportation and that the tourist objects visited are art metamorphosis travel hyperrealitysacred places and natural and human recreational places the factors motive ting thewomen to travel are inter personal cultural status and prestige the things making theminterested in travelling are the castle of chillon in switzerland and the regionss history theevening party in italy as a tradition to welcome new people the architectures of caesarspalaces the coliseum and chandrapore club as a tradition to welcome new people the bridgeparty to know the language spoken and dress worn  traditional costumes of india koyasan asbuddhist religion and paris as the centre of dress model cultural barriers refer to differentetiquettes ideologies and moral values resulting in different ways of travelling and theirsolutions knowing the culture of the destination that is going to be visited is really needed at least inorder not to know nothing at all about such a destination furthermore it reduces culturalbarriers that is why cross cultural understanding is really necessarily given not only to thedoers of tourism but also to all institutions in order to reduce misunderstanding and increaseappreciation towards each other,23382449,11
11,"Saluang sirompak is a type of music which has spiritual strength and is performed at Taeh Baruah, Payakumbuh District, Lima Puluh Koto Regency, Minangkabau, West Sumatra. It is performed to bewitch a girl who has humiliated a young man who would like to propose her. This activity is called Basirompak. The Saluang Sirompak performed in Basirompak is supported by what is called gasiang tangkurak, a chant sung with magic formula and an offering. It is performed at one of the seven tanjungs around Taeh Baruah. The problems of the study are formulated as follows. (1) What is the spirituality of the saluang sirompak music performed at Taeh Baruah, Minangkabau like? (2) What is the spiritual function of the saluang sirompak music performed at Taeh Baruah, Minangkabau?, and (3) what is the meaning and implication of the spirituality of the saluang sirompak music on the customs and traditions and religion of the Taeh Baruah community, Minangkabau? The theory of Deconstruction supported by the theory of Aesthetics and the theory of Semiotics was used in the present study. The data were qualitatively analyzed.

11,"Sidewalk traders, as informal economic sector, have been in existence in almost allthe cities in Indonesia. As an impact of migration of people, they have been recognized as astructural phenomenon which will always exist. They will always exist in Denpasar City. InWest Denpasar Sub District, as part of Denpasar City, their existence has been assumed notonly to cause the city to look disorganized but it has also been assumed to create discomfortand to disturb public order. However, as Indonesian citizens, they have the right to haveoccupation and live properly as stated in Article 27 of the 1945 Constitution. Theempowerment management of the sidewalk traders in West Denpasar Sub District refers tothe Local Rules and Regulations (Perda) of number 3 of Year 2000. However, the fact inthe field shows that what has been expected has not been properly coming true yet.Based on this fact, a research was conducted with the problems formulated asfollows: 1) how the government managed the empowerment of the sidewalk traders; 2)what responses were given by the community to the model of such a management ofempowerment; 3) and what were its effects and meanings. As a consequence, this researchaims at 1) identifying the management of empowerment of the sidewalk traders; 2)identifying the responses given by the community to the model of such a management ofempowerment; 3) identifying its effects and meanings. From the aspect of methodology,this research is classified as a qualitative one. The theory of deconstruction, the theory ofhegemony, the theory of response, the theory of motivation and achievement wereemployed for exploring the problems formulated above. The techniques employed forcollecting the data needed were the technique of observation, the technique of interview,the technique of observation and focus discussion group.The findings show that the Local Rules and Regulations (Perda) of Number 3 of2000, which is derived from the Local Rules and Regulations (Perda) of Number 15 ofYear 1993, which is used as the reference of how such a management of empowerment isconducted, does not accommodate the problems related to the sidewalk traders.

11,"At the dawn of this third millennium, growing numbers of forums worldwide are focused on the issue of how to sustain the diversity of the nature and of cultures for the well-being of the Earth and humanity. Concurrently, intercultural and interreligious dialogue is deemed essential for social cohesion. This dissertation advances the contributions of religiosity in art through a qualitative reflective account and chronicle of the art and dialogues offered by people of diverse cultures and faiths from 1999 to 2004 during Sharing Art &amp; Religiosity in the vicinity of Pura Samuan Tiga in Bedulu, Bali and Sharing Art Ocean– Mountain at  the  seacoast village of Tejakula, North  Bali;  seen in  tandem  with creative transformations that occurred through Sharing Art in and with other cultural environments of the world. Methodologically this study stemmed from and demonstrates the merits of public participatory   practice-based   art   programs   whereby   activities   are   conceived   by   and implemented with the people of a locale. Participants generated the data and interpretations via mutual cooperation, dialogue, and creative praxis. The Balinese principle of Tri Hita Karana, that aims toward a harmonious human-nature-God/Source of Life relationship in accord with the place-time-conditions, provided a holistic perspective to analyze and derive meaning from the results. Findings indicate sharing in the arts, religiosity, and nature fosters a common field such that traditional and modern cultures can study and engage in creative dialogue together. Moreover, interreligious innovations that have continued to develop since the seminal deliberation  of  reconciliation  between  Bali  Aga,  Çiwaist,  and  Buddhist  faith  groups  at Samuan Tiga circa CE 989 to 1011 and intercultural egalitarian innovations since the seventeenth century dialogue of indigenous and migrant mountain and maritime cultures in Tejakula – constitute a model for furthering bhinneka tunggal ika unity in diversity in the world today. Recommendations outline how the findings can be used for cooperative exchanges between villages and between villages and cities of diverse regions and countries to support interculture in cultural environments. Appendices provide two video compact discs; seventy- nine  reflective  essays  by artists,  religious/spiritual leaders,  scholars,  and  educators  from across the world; and nine transcriptions of initial public dialogues.","RELIGIOSITY IN ART INSPIRED BY SAMUAN TIGA AND TEJAKULA, BALI: UNITY IN DIVERSITY",2012-11-26,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,religiosity in art inspired by samuan tiga and tejakula bali unity in diversity at the dawn of this third millennium growing numbers of forums worldwide are focused on the issue of how to sustain the diversity of the nature and of cultures for the wellbeing of the earth and humanity concurrently intercultural and interreligious dialogue is deemed essential for social cohesion this dissertation advances the contributions of religiosity in art through a qualitative reflective account and chronicle of the art and dialogues offered by people of diverse cultures and faiths from  to  during sharing art  religiosity in the vicinity of pura samuan tiga in bedulu bali and sharing art ocean mountain at the seacoast village of tejakula north bali seen in tandem with creative transformations that occurred through sharing art in and with other cultural environments of the world methodologically this study stemmed from and demonstrates the merits of public participatory practicebased art programs whereby activities are conceived by and implemented with the people of a locale participants generated the data and interpretations via mutual cooperation dialogue and creative praxis the balinese principle of tri hita karana that aims toward a harmonious humannaturegodsource of life relationship in accord with the placetimeconditions provided a holistic perspective to analyze and derive meaning from the results findings indicate sharing in the arts religiosity and nature fosters a common field such that traditional and modern cultures can study and engage in creative dialogue together moreover interreligious innovations that have continued to develop since the seminal deliberation of reconciliation between bali aga çiwaist and buddhist faith groups at samuan tiga circa ce  to  and intercultural egalitarian innovations since the seventeenth century dialogue of indigenous and migrant mountain and maritime cultures in tejakula  constitute a model for furthering bhinneka tunggal ika unity in diversity in the world today recommendations outline how the findings can be used for cooperative exchanges between villages and between villages and cities of diverse regions and countries to support interculture in cultural environments appendices provide two video compact discs seventy nine reflective essays by artists religiousspiritual leaders scholars and educators from across the world and nine transcriptions of initial public dialogues,23382449,11

11,"This study is intended to analyze the discourse of Bali TV coverage on the Kemoning –Budaga case, Bali, a conflict which took place on 17 September 2011, which  led to discourse of the dispersal of the traditional village ‘desa pakraman’. Such coverage of the case was considered blaming the Governor of Bali, Mangku Pastika. He was reported to intend to disperse the traditional villages in Bali. The Bali TV and Bali Post, which are under the Bali Post Media Group ‘Kelompok Media Bali Post’ (abbreviated to KMB) continuously exploited the discourse of the dispersal of the traditional village subjectively. The Governor of Bali, Mangku Made Pastika, did not accept that and prosecuted the Bali Post in Denpasar Court of First Instance ‘Pengadilan Negeri Denpasar’. The theory of discourse, the theory of agenda setting, the framing theory, and the theory of semiotics are used in the present study.   The result of the analysis shows that the conflict between Kemoning Village and Budaga Village covered by the Bali Post was an extended discourse of the Bali Post printed media which was managed using a clear setting agenda for the social, political, and ideological interests of the KMB’s Ajeg Bali.  The relation between the Governor of Bali, Mangku Made Pastika, and KMB, which was good in the beginning, changed into a serious conflict.

11,"Conflict among parties of subak ecosystem is a conflict of interests resulting from themodernization made by political community with regard to the subculture ofpelemahan of ecosystem. The political and economic communities forcemodernization on the subak ecosystem leading to an ideological conflict betweenmodernism and the philosophy of Trihita Karana. Modernism has been responsiblefor the conflict among the parties of ecosystem in palemahan, pawongan andparhyangan of the subaks irrigated by Sabha River.Participation in group discussion, semi structured interview and transek were themethods employed in collecting the data. The triangulation including at least threerelevant theories was employed for analyzing the data.Political communities interfere with the development by applying the theoryof hegemony. The political community in collaboration with the economic communitydominates modernization which is sectoral in nature and the planning andimplementation of the development. Partial development approach, which contrastswith the theory of ecosystem (Pollunin, 1996), causes the farming community lifeprocess and the cultural values existing in the ecosystem of the subak to degrade. Theinterference of the political community in collaboration with the economiccommunity with the subak ecosystem is more dominant in the subculture ofpalemahan which is materialistic in nature so that advantages can be obtained byscience and technology. Consequently, the philosophical values of trihita karana arebroken. Such a conflict takes place due to the different interests in the subakecosystem , which is full of cultural values for the farming community. Alteration tothe land status, the imbalance between the cost spent and the yields produced and theviolation of the growing pattern are responsible for the conflict.The institution of subak, which constitutes the realization of subculture of thesubak ecosystem, is swept aside by the political and economic communities. Thefarming community members that are the members of the subak institution are madenot to be facilitated to take part in the development process in the subculture ofpalemahan . Modernization in the subculture of palemahan of the subak ecosystemdone by the political and economic communities is beyond the subak institutioncausing it to violate the traditional values of the subak institution which refer totogetherness regulated by the subak rules and regulations. Modernization, which isdone by the political and economic societies by science and technology, breaks theunified existence of Trihita Karana in the subak ecosystem environment.Modernization in the development of the subculture of palemahan ecosystem degrades the spiritual values attached to the subculture of parahyangan. Thedevelopmental intervention in the subculture of palemahan done by the political andeconomical communities is not begun from the implementation of the subculture ofparahyangan. This contrasts with the cultural values existing in the subak ecosystem.The conflict of subak ecosystem among the parties results from the failure ofmodernization. The developmental intervention is only done in the subculture ofpalemahan, while the subcultures of pawongan and parahyangan of the subakecosystem are marginalized from their habitats. The failure in developing theinfrastructure of the subculture of palemahan of the subak ecosystem in the areasirrigated by Sabha River results from the fact that the subaks are functioned to be thedevelopmental objects. In this case, the theory of participatory can offer solutions tothe conflict and the developmental failure, especially in the ecosystem of subaksirrigated by Sabha River. The reason is that the parties play equal roles in developingthe environment of the subak ecosystem.",CONFLICT AMONG PARTIES IN MODERNIZATION OF ECOSYSTEMS AT SUBAKS LOCATED IN BULELENG AND TABANAN REGENCIES OF BALI AT IRRIGATED BY SHABA RIVER,2012-11-26,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,conflict among parties in modernization of ecosystems at subaks located in buleleng and tabanan regencies of bali at irrigated by shaba river conflict among parties of subak ecosystem is a conflict of interests resulting from themodernization made by political community with regard to the subculture ofpelemahan of ecosystem the political and economic communities forcemodernization on the subak ecosystem leading to an ideological conflict betweenmodernism and the philosophy of trihita karana modernism has been responsiblefor the conflict among the parties of ecosystem in palemahan pawongan andparhyangan of the subaks irrigated by sabha river participation in group discussion semi structured interview and transek were themethods employed in collecting the data the triangulation including at least threerelevant theories was employed for analyzing the data political communities interfere with the development by applying the theoryof hegemony the political community in collaboration with the economic communitydominates modernization which is sectoral in nature and the planning andimplementation of the development partial development approach which contrastswith the theory of ecosystem pollunin  causes the farming community lifeprocess and the cultural values existing in the ecosystem of the subak to degrade theinterference of the political community in collaboration with the economiccommunity with the subak ecosystem is more dominant in the subculture ofpalemahan which is materialistic in nature so that advantages can be obtained byscience and technology consequently the philosophical values of trihita karana arebroken such a conflict takes place due to the different interests in the subakecosystem  which is full of cultural values for the farming community alteration tothe land status the imbalance between the cost spent and the yields produced and theviolation of the growing pattern are responsible for the conflict the institution of subak which constitutes the realization of subculture of thesubak ecosystem is swept aside by the political and economic communities thefarming community members that are the members of the subak institution are madenot to be facilitated to take part in the development process in the subculture ofpalemahan  modernization in the subculture of palemahan of the subak ecosystemdone by the political and economic communities is beyond the subak institutioncausing it to violate the traditional values of the subak institution which refer totogetherness regulated by the subak rules and regulations modernization which isdone by the political and economic societies by science and technology breaks theunified existence of trihita karana in the subak ecosystem environment modernization in the development of the subculture of palemahan ecosystemdegrades the spiritual values attached to the subculture of parahyangan thedevelopmental intervention in the subculture of palemahan done by the political andeconomical communities is not begun from the implementation of the subculture ofparahyangan this contrasts with the cultural values existing in the subak ecosystem the conflict of subak ecosystem among the parties results from the failure ofmodernization the developmental intervention is only done in the subculture ofpalemahan while the subcultures of pawongan and parahyangan of the subakecosystem are marginalized from their habitats the failure in developing theinfrastructure of the subculture of palemahan of the subak ecosystem in the areasirrigated by sabha river results from the fact that the subaks are functioned to be thedevelopmental objects in this case the theory of participatory can offer solutions tothe conflict and the developmental failure especially in the ecosystem of subaksirrigated by sabha river the reason is that the parties play equal roles in developingthe environment of the subak ecosystem,23382449,11

The study used the theory of formula, the theory of semiotics, and the theory of practice, especially the practice of capital. The data were collected using the techniques of observation, interview, and documentation. Sa Ngaza is unique in regard to its pattern of formula in the same dimension in general and in the opening and closing formulas in particular. These formulas support the transmission of TLS, causing mori Sa Ngaza (the Sa Ngaza reporter) to be able to maintain the continuity of TLS and its growth in RA and RKA. The opening formula explains the identities of the characters. The thematic formula in RA and RKA reports different contents. TLS in RA emphasizes patadela (the ancestor’s massage); TLS in RKA emphasizes the Biblical massage. The meaning plurality in RA and RKA explains the acculturative relationship between the tradition and religion. In this relationship there is a shift in the identities of the characters, sa’o (the traditional house), and patadela.

11,"Tektekan Calonarang is a Calonarang drama dance which is performed for a new model of tourism, and is accompanied with what is referred to gamelan tektekan. In general, the Balinese people disagree that a sacred cultural element is performed for tourism. However, those living at Baturiti Village support the commodified Tektekan Calongarang in which what are referred to as sacred barong and rangda are performed. This has led to many questions as such a performing art contrasts with the Balinese people’s attitude in general. The problems of the present study are formulated as follows: why the people living at Baturiti Village, Kerambitan, Tabanan,  support the commodified Tektekan Calongarang using the sacred rangda and barong; what was such a commodification like; what was its implication on those who were involved in it, society, and such a performance itself. This present study is a qualitative one in which a number of related critical theories were used such as the theory of deconstruction proposed Jacques Derrida, the theory of social practice proposed by Pierre Bourdieu, and the theory of power/knowledge proposed by Michael Foucault. The result of the study showed that the commodified Tektekan Calonarang in which the sacred barong and rangda were used was performed in the forms of a procession and the Tektekan Calonarang performance. The market ideology, the developmental ideology, the religious ideology, and the conservation ideology inspired the commodified Tektekan Calonarang which involved the sacred barong and rangda performed for tourism. Such a commodification increased the income of those involving in such a performance and the local people (multiplier effects), the perpetuity of the magical strength of such barong and rangda, the market/tourism interest, and strengthened the local people’s social solidarity. The novelty of the present study was that there was no degradation of sacredness although the sacred rangda and barong were commodified for tourism. The reason is that every time such a performance was performed, a ritual was performed to purify such barong and rangda contextually.","COMMODIFICATION OF TEKTEKAN CALONGARANG AT BATURITI, KERAMBITAN, TABANAN",2016-05-01,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,commodification of tektekan calongarang at baturiti kerambitan tabanan tektekan calonarang is a calonarang drama dance which is performed for a new model of tourism and is accompanied with what is referred to gamelan tektekan in general the balinese people disagree that a sacred cultural element is performed for tourism however those living at baturiti village support the commodified tektekan calongarang in which what are referred to as sacred barong and rangda are performed this has led to many questions as such a performing art contrasts with the balinese peoples attitude in general the problems of the present study are formulated as follows why the people living at baturiti village kerambitan tabanan support the commodified tektekan calongarang using the sacred rangda and barong what was such a commodification like what was its implication on those who were involved in it society and such a performance itself this present study is a qualitative one in which a number of related critical theories were used such as the theory of deconstruction proposed jacques derrida the theory of social practice proposed by pierre bourdieu and the theory of powerknowledge proposed by michael foucault the result of the study showed that the commodified tektekan calonarang in which the sacred barong and rangda were used was performed in the forms of a procession and the tektekan calonarang performance the market ideology the developmental ideology the religious ideology and the conservation ideology inspired the commodified tektekan calonarang which involved the sacred barong and rangda performed for tourism such a commodification increased the income of those involving in such a performance and the local people multiplier effects the perpetuity of the magical strength of such barong and rangda the markettourism interest and strengthened the local peoples social solidarity the novelty of the present study was that there was no degradation of sacredness although the sacred rangda and barong were commodified for tourism the reason is that every time such a performance was performed a ritual was performed to purify such barong and rangda contextually,23382449,11

The tradition of mabarung of performing art which was created in Buleleng Regency constitutes the competitive arena of life in which every pebarung (the player who is involved) does his best to perform the best by optimally presenting the quality of his performance. Based on what was described above, it was necessary to reveal the tradition of mabarung of performing art in Buleleng Regency. The present study focused on the meaningfulness of the implied ideology of the mabarung of performing art in Buleleng Regency.  The result of the study showed that the cultural representation, which was actualized into the mabarung of performing art appeared from the ideas of the grass- root. The government interfered in the mabarung of performing art and a change took place; the mabarung of performing art which used to be freely performed was then performed as a festival/competition, causing the ideology it contained to change. The phenomenon of the mabarung of performing art reflected a self image; the players felt embarrassed if they lost ‘majengah-jengahan’, performed differently from others, and felt too proud of themselves ‘ajum’. In relation to that, it could be identified that the cultural representation which created the tradition of mabarung of performing art in Buleleng Regency was inspired by the ideology of freedom and self existence.",IDEOLOGY OF MABARUNG (COMPETITION) OF PERFORMING ART  IN BULELENG REGENCY,2014-03-22,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,ideology of mabarung competition of performing art  in buleleng regency mabarung competition of performing art is a cultural heritage in north bali and has highly contributed to the development of the balinese art and culture the tradition of mabarung of performing art which was created in buleleng regency constitutes the competitive arena of life in which every pebarung the player who is involved does his best to perform the best by optimally presenting the quality of his performance based on what was described above it was necessary to reveal the tradition of mabarung of performing art in buleleng regency the present study focused on the meaningfulness of the implied ideology of the mabarung of performing art in buleleng regency  the result of the study showed that the cultural representation which was actualized into the mabarung of performing art appeared from the ideas of the grass root the government interfered in the mabarung of performing art and a change took place the mabarung of performing art which used to be freely performed was then performed as a festivalcompetition causing the ideology it contained to change the phenomenon of the mabarung of performing art reflected a self image the players felt embarrassed if they lost majengahjengahan performed differently from others and felt too proud of themselves ajum in relation to that it could be identified that the cultural representation which created the tradition of mabarung of performing art in buleleng regency was inspired by the ideology of freedom and self existence,23382449,11

11,"Since the New Order government the religious politics has obliged residents to adhere to one of the five official religions, causing the Mbawa society to be a plural one. They have welcome Christianity and Islam, but they still maintain their old belief, that is, Parafu. Movements have appeared in the society. The people were between peace and conflict. The last movements led to violence, taking place in 1969, 1972, and 2000. The Raju cultural practice is maintained within the context of Islamic and Christian contestations, and has been used as the arena of cultural fight. This present study discusses how the Raju ritual frees itself and its supporting people from the conflict, and how it is transformed into a means of supervising peace. The perspective of the critical theory was used in the present study to explore the texts of the Mbawa society. The discourse analysis was used to guide the discussion. Based on the fieldwork done at Mbawa from 2011 to 2014, several constructions of the Raju cultural practices were found. First, the Raju practice refers to the maintenance of identity and supremacy of the Mbawa society as conserver of the ancestor’s tradition; second, the Raju cultural practice functions as a mechanism of internal solidarity, so horizontal conflict can be avoided; and third, the Raju cultural practice plays a role as a means of revealing the “resistance” to as well as “acceptance” of the other people’s cultural domination. The finding of the study gives better understanding of the tradition-based management of conflict. It is such a character which, to some extent, has caused the Raju cultural practice to be the practice of management conflict.

The study is intended to (1) find out the resolution of the traditional conflict between Kemoning Traditional Village and Budaga Traditional Village which was dominated by MajelisUtamaDesaPakraman (MUDP); (2) identify the mechanism through which the decision was made by MUDP to settle such a traditional conflict; (3) identify the implication of the settlement of such a traditional conflict on the relationship between Budaga Traditional Village and Kemoning TraditionalVillage after the decision was made by MUDP. This present study is also aimed at finding out the picture of such a conflict between the two traditional villages. The study used the qualitative method.  The data were collected through observation, interview, library research, and documentary study. The theoretical approach which includes the theory of hegemony, the theory of mediation, and the theory of deconstruction was also used. The result of the study shows that the local traditional law ‘awig-awigdesapakaraman’ could not always be used as a reference to settle the dispute between the two villages. Every attempt made by the MUDP in relation to the resolution which was proposed in the earlier stages was considered unfair. The mechanism through which such a conflict was settled was dominated by the MUDP and did not show any decision which reflected the principles of mediation. The implication of the settlement of such a conflict between the two traditional villages was that the relationship between them had not been in harmony.","RESOLUTION OF TRADITIONAL CONFLICT BETWEEN KOMUNING TRADITIONAL VILLAGE AND BUDAGA TRADITIONAL VILLAGE IN KLUNGKUNG, BALI",2016-08-01,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,resolution of traditional conflict between komuning traditional village and budaga traditional village in klungkung bali this present study discusses the traditional conflict between budagatraditional village and kemoning traditional village klungkung regency bali province the study is intended to  find out the resolution of the traditional conflict between kemoning traditional village and budaga traditional village which was dominated by majelisutamadesapakraman mudp  identify the mechanism through which the decision was made by mudp to settle such a traditional conflict  identify the implication of the settlement of such a traditional conflict on the relationship between budaga traditional village and kemoning traditionalvillage after the decision was made by mudp this present study is also aimed at finding out the picture of such a conflict between the two traditional villages the study used the qualitative method  the data were collected through observation interview library research and documentary study the theoretical approach which includes the theory of hegemony the theory of mediation and the theory of deconstruction was also used the result of the study shows that the local traditional law awigawigdesapakaraman could not always be used as a reference to settle the dispute between the two villages every attempt made by the mudp in relation to the resolution which was proposed in the earlier stages was considered unfair the mechanism through which such a conflict was settled was dominated by the mudp and did not show any decision which reflected the principles of mediation the implication of the settlement of such a conflict between the two traditional villages was that the relationship between them had not been in harmony,23382449,11
11,"This research explores the socio-political dynamics taking place at KutaTraditional Village, Bali: from desa adat (traditional village) to desa pekraman (anothertype of traditional village) in the perspective of cultural studies. There are three problemsformulated in this research. The first problem is how the socio-political dynamics fromdesa adat (traditional village) to desa pekraman (another type of traditional village) tookplace at Kuta? The next problem is how the traditional village interacted with theadministrative village at Kuta? And the last problem, which is the third, is what were theimpacts and meanings of the change from desa adat to desa pekraman? In this studyqualitative method was employed. And the data needed was obtained by employing thetechnique of in-depth interview, the technique of participatory observation, anddocumentation study. To give responses to the problems mentioned above, the theory ofhegemony, the theory of deconstruction, the theory of conflict, the theory of power andknowledge and the theory of eclectically symbolic interaction were applied.The findings show that the socio-political dynamics taking place Kuta TraditionalVillage resulted in turbulence among the villagers. This is indicated by the Local Rulesand Regulations (Perda) issued by Desa Pekraman of Number 3 of Year 2001. Thiscould be responsible for the factors of pro’s and con’s in various aspects. Clause (6) ofArticle 3 of the Perda of Number 3 of Year 2001 was reversed by the leaders of KutaTraditional Village. They did not agree that non-Hindu people were included as thetraditional village members.As far as the interaction between the traditional village and the administrativevillage is concerned, the governmental hegemony took place. The government appliedhegemony to the traditional village through the administrative village in the form of rulesand regulations. The local rules and regulations issued by the desa pekraman, as a legalproduct in Bali, are left crystallized sociologically, philosophically, and juridically. However, the dynamism of the traditional villagers in Bali will “justify” to what extentsuch rules and regulations are justified and to what extent they are protective. The changeof the Perda issued by the desa adat into that issued by the desa pekraman was notfollowed by Kuta Traditional Village by replacing the awig-awig (rules and regulations)issued by the desa adat or making loose agreements to adapt to the higher rules andregulations in addition to anticipating the migrants through the change in rules andregulations applicable at Kuta Traditional Village. Basically, the socio-political dynamicstaking place at Kuta Traditional Village as a consequence of the change made from desaadat to desa pekraman resulted in no important things. However, from the “substance”point of view, the change can be seen in the formation of Majelis Desa Pekraman (theAssembly of Desa Pekraman) (Article 14), which is formed from below, and in theappearance of pecalang (traditional security) which is responsible for the security andorderliness of the village area especially when traditional and religious activities areperformed. Actually, pecalang is an “old product” which is newly packaged with “newenthusiasm” and is included in the Perda of Number 3 of Year 2001 issued by the DesaPekraman . The meanings created by the change made from Desa Adat to DesaPekraman are transformational, dialogic and dynamic. The desa pekraman is in the ongoingprocess (which will never come to an end) of being integrated into theadministrative village.The findings show that there were multiple interpretations given by the leaders ofKuta Traditional Village, as far as the articles in the Perda issued by the Desa Pekramanare concerned, governmental hegemony which was in the form of Rules and Regulationsas the social transformation of the State by which villages are organized.","SOCIO-POLITICAL DYNAMICS TAKING PLACE AT KUTA TRADITIONAL VILLAGE, BALI: FROM DESA ADAT (TRADITIONAL VILLAGE) TO DESA PEKRAMAN (ANOTHER TYPE OF TRADITIONAL VILLAGE) IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF CULTURAL STUDIES",2012-11-26,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,sociopolitical dynamics taking place at kuta traditional village bali from desa adat traditional village to desa pekraman another type of traditional village in the perspective of cultural studies this research explores the sociopolitical dynamics taking place at kutatraditional village bali from desa adat traditional village to desa pekraman anothertype of traditional village in the perspective of cultural studies there are three problemsformulated in this research the first problem is how the sociopolitical dynamics fromdesa adat traditional village to desa pekraman another type of traditional village tookplace at kuta the next problem is how the traditional village interacted with theadministrative village at kuta and the last problem which is the third is what were theimpacts and meanings of the change from desa adat to desa pekraman in this studyqualitative method was employed and the data needed was obtained by employing thetechnique of indepth interview the technique of participatory observation anddocumentation study to give responses to the problems mentioned above the theory ofhegemony the theory of deconstruction the theory of conflict the theory of power andknowledge and the theory of eclectically symbolic interaction were applied the findings show that the sociopolitical dynamics taking place kuta traditionalvillage resulted in turbulence among the villagers this is indicated by the local rulesand regulations perda issued by desa pekraman of number  of year  thiscould be responsible for the factors of pros and cons in various aspects clause  ofarticle  of the perda of number  of year  was reversed by the leaders of kutatraditional village they did not agree that nonhindu people were included as thetraditional village members as far as the interaction between the traditional village and the administrativevillage is concerned the governmental hegemony took place the government appliedhegemony to the traditional village through the administrative village in the form of rulesand regulations the local rules and regulations issued by the desa pekraman as a legalproduct in bali are left crystallized sociologically philosophically and juridically however the dynamism of the traditional villagers in bali will justify to what extentsuch rules and regulations are justified and to what extent they are protective the changeof the perda issued by the desa adat into that issued by the desa pekraman was notfollowed by kuta traditional village by replacing the awigawig rules and regulationsissued by the desa adat or making loose agreements to adapt to the higher rules andregulations in addition to anticipating the migrants through the change in rules andregulations applicable at kuta traditional village basically the sociopolitical dynamicstaking place at kuta traditional village as a consequence of the change made from desaadat to desa pekraman resulted in no important things however from the substancepoint of view the change can be seen in the formation of majelis desa pekraman theassembly of desa pekraman article  which is formed from below and in theappearance of pecalang traditional security which is responsible for the security andorderliness of the village area especially when traditional and religious activities areperformed actually pecalang is an old product which is newly packaged with newenthusiasm and is included in the perda of number  of year  issued by the desapekraman  the meanings created by the change made from desa adat to desapekraman are transformational dialogic and dynamic the desa pekraman is in the ongoingprocess which will never come to an end of being integrated into theadministrative village the findings show that there were multiple interpretations given by the leaders ofkuta traditional village as far as the articles in the perda issued by the desa pekramanare concerned governmental hegemony which was in the form of rules and regulationsas the social transformation of the state by which villages are organized,23382449,11

11,"This present study discussed the marginalization of the Parwa Leather Puppet in Gianyar Regency in the globalization era. It discussed the form, the causing factors, and the impact of marginalization. The qualitative interpretative method was used to analyze the problems of the study. The data were collected using the techniques of observation, in-depth interview, documentary study, and library research. The data were qualitatively analyzed. The results of the study showed that there were several forms of marginalization occurring to the Parwa Leather Puppet ‘Wayang Kulit Parwa’ (WKP) in Gianyar Regency. This was indicated by the change in the context of performance and indication of marginalization. The forms of the context of performance were made up of the facts that (a) the viewers shifted from the young generation to the old generation; (b) it used to be performed as an offering but now it was performed as a commodity or comodification; (c) technology played more important roles (the lighting, sound system, and the material for making the puppet), and d) the accompanying gamelan orchestra changed. Marginalization was indicated by (a) the fall in the frequency of performance, (b) WKP was getting less popular in the community; (c) fewer people were getting interested in WKP performance; and (e) WKP was getting less respected. The factors responsible for the marginalization of WKP in Gianyar Regency were the facts that less people were interested in WKP, the decrease in the WKP puppeteer’s activities, the policy issued by the traditional institution was weak, and the supervision made by the local government of Gianyar was weak. In addition, WKP was less prospective; the current community needed more amusement than guidance, the rise in the impact of foreign cultural art, more and more sources of modern amusements were made available, and the impact of telecommunication technology.

11,"The phenomenon of forest clearance is a holistic problem which has caused a forest not to function optimally. The first consequence of forest clearance is felt by the people living around the forest. It can lead to fire, landslide and the disappearance of water source. It can also cause the micro climate to decrease. The theories used in the present study are the theory of power discourse and knowledge proposed by Foucault, the theory of hegemony proposed by Antonio Gramci, and the theory of communication action, proposed by Habermas.   It was found that; first, those who cleared the trees growing in the forest area away come from the surrounding villages. The culture of such a forest clearance had been done from generation to generation. The closer they lived to the forest area, the more cattle they raised. They raised more or less four cattle without being supported with how to prepare the food they need. Second, the government had made many attempts to overcome the forest clearance at the Kubu Forest Management Resort “Resor Pengelolaan Hutan (RPH) Kubu”; however, the attempts which it had made was not well communicated.

11,"Sukawati District, Gianyar Regency is one of the tourist attractions anddestinations. Sukawati has Sukawati art market and Guwang market, art shops,craftsmen, wood carvers, painters, traditional and contemporary artists. They all completethe atmosphere at Sukawati. As a result, more and more people intend to build housesthere for which more and more electric energy is needed. This study was conducted toevaluate the use of electric energy at Sukawati District. The problems are formulated asfollows: how electric energy is used; how comodification takes place; how thegovernment and Perusahaan Listrik Negara, abbreviated to PLN (the Utility Company)dominates people and how the people resist the government’s hegemony, what are theeffects and meanings of the electric energy used at Sukawati District.Qualitative method supported by quantitative data, which characterize CulturalStudies, was adopted in this study. The data were taken from primary resources andsecondary resources. Qualitative method was eclectically employed for analyzing thedata supported by the theory of consumer behavior, the theory of comodification, thetheory of hegemony, the theory of knowledge and power and the theory ofdeconstruction. The results of the study were formally presented using tables, graphs andpictures and were informally narrated.The results of the study show that the increase in the number of population hasresulted in the increase in the number of traditional houses without/with slightmodification and modern houses. The rise in the number of houses has resulted in the risein electricity needed for illumination, mechanical purposes and so forth. The peopleliving at traditional houses use less and simpler electric utilities than those living atmodern houses. The electric utilities used are highly influenced by both internal andexternal factors. The advertisements of electric utilities also contribute to the use ofelectric utilities, meaning that electricity has touched what is required by the people atSukawati District. By referring to the 1945 Constitution, the PLN has dominated thedistribution of electricity. This has been used to comodify electric energy by changing itsstatus into a limited liability company, and to increase the basic rate of electricity (tarifdasar listrik, abbreviated to TDL) with its various scenarios socialized through massmedia. The government and the PLN dominate the community to accelerate their comodification practices. Such a dominance or hegemony is resisted by the traditionalpeople by strengthening their Balinese identity through the preservation of Balitraditional houses. Electricity has covered all the banjar/dusun (neighborhood under avillage) resulting in different effects such as giving up bathing in the public bathingplace, the extinction of informal communication among the people, renegotiation ofsacred values, change in orientation of the sekas (the traditional groups established forparticular purposes) from being orientated their activities to non economic motivationsinto economic ones.

The aspectswhich have changed, as the result of the shift from agricultural culture to tourism culture since1970, include the spatial relationship between man and God (parhyangan), the spatial relationshipbetween man and his environment (palemahan), and the spatial relationship between man and hisfellow being or the three things which cause physical and spiritual prosperity among human beings.This research in cultural studies was conducted to reveal the spatial alteration which hadtaken place at Ubud Traditional Market in the globalization era especially since 1970 as theconsequence of the fast development in tourism. The data were analyzed by applying qualitativeanalysis technique, eclecticism of the theory of change, the theory of space, the theory ofhegemony, and critical and practical theories. The research was conducted by employing qualitativemethod which features cultural studies.The results of the research show that the increase in population and in what is needed bytourism has led to the spatial alteration in parhyangan in the village and home levels. The spatialalteration in pawongan as a unity of membership (krama) does not take place and the spatialalternation in families does not either. This indicates that Ubud Traditional Village is getting morecomplex in facing modern and global condition with its commercial culture. Its tradition,agricultural culture and nature have contributed to the development of tourism. In regard topalemahan, catus patha has not been the only center of orientation any more. The settlement of thepopulation has followed the development of tourist facilities. Tourism has also altered the landusefulness causing zero-settlement based on groups of banjar (neighborhood under a traditionalvillage) to be irrelevant. In regard to the patterns of space occupied by families, the walls built toseparate one family from another have been demolished; the buildings (bale) have beenrehabilitated, teba (the unoccupied part of a compound where animals raised for sale are usuallykept and rubbish are usually gathered) has been exploited.

11,"Globalization with all its implications has affected the life of Dayak Lawangan living in Central Dusun. Modernization has caused balian bawo to be getting scarce. The number of the speakers of balian bawo is decreasing, and it seems that no young generation is interested in it, although its existence still functions in various aspects of the Dayak Lawangan community’s life. In addition, the young generation is less interested in becoming balian bawo. This will affect the process of the regeneration of balian bawo. The result of the present study shows that the practice of balian waho is obtained through the myth and process of becoming balian bawo. This causes balian bawo to be the central position in the practice of balian bawo ritual. Balian waho plays an important role in the healing and purifying processes. It functions to prevent both manifest and latent misfortunes. It is the socio-cultural supporting life regulation for Dayak Lawangan. It is made up of religiosity, culture conservation, social life, and aesthetics. The formal education, the discontinuity of the internationalization process in families, the low income earned by those who work as balian bawo, their risky responsibility, the spiritual and physical abilities they need, and their religious and psychological ideologies have caused those who are interested in becoming balian bawo to decrease. The impacts are that the dimensions of time and magic formula as part of the ritual practice will change. In addition, the ideological struggle for the ritual practice of balian bawo, and the change in the population of balian waho will also result from the scarcity of the population of balian waho.

11,"The development of technology, the economic system, and the culture of new music, has caused the Balinese pop music to be industrialized since 1990s. The existence of many recording studios and musicians (composers, singers, and music players) and many other related products all over Bali has also contributed to this. Through the recording products, various types of direct performances and so forth have caused the Balinese pop music to be the commodity of the capitalistic pop culture which is preferred by society.

This present study was conducted in order to identify the phenomenon of one of three powers in such industrialization, namely, the power of media, especially television. The result of the study shows that the power of television media in the industrialization of the Balinese pop music is the resource which contributes to the distribution of products which are produced for the market or the prospective market in Bali.

Various forms ofdemocracy and autonomy transformation in the village governance took place duringthe transition era. In the first stage, the primary and secondary data were collected. Inthe second stage, the theory applied for examining the data was chosen, and in thethird stage, the collected and classified data were analyzed and interpreted. In thefourth stage the results of the study were reported and constructed. The theoriesapplied in this study include; democracy, political democracy, substantial democracy,decentrali zation and political culture. The approaches applied were Tranpolitic andpost-structuralism.The results of the study showed that; first, the village democracy in the firsttransition era (1998-1999) was mostly still uniform, and there were not many choicesin the implementation of the village democracy. The village autonomy was stillblocked in centralistic pattern, homogeneous with hierarchical structure. Second, inthe second transition era (2000-2004) the role of the village representatives became sodemocratic accompanied by the extended village autonomy. Third, in the thirdtransition era (2005-2008) democracy became retransformed to the procedural patternaccompanied by the strengthening of supra village government power decreasing theautonomy of the villages. Fourth, democracy and autonomy transformationcontributed to the demand for the strengthening of democracy institutions, bettercommunity participation and more accountable public services, transparence and responsiveness to what was needed by the people. Fifth, democracy and villageautonomy transformation, in addition to having the sense of involving the activeparticipation of the society in the village governance, also had the sense ofstrengthening the civil and political society in every village social organization whichactualized what was needed by the society.

11,"This dissertation discusses the representation of the Divine and human being imagery in theentity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza in the village of Guru Sina in Ngada Regency, Flores. The empiricproblems of this dissertasion are connected with the marginalized phenomenon of the local religionthat submerged in the entity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza and its ritual practices. This probelm is relevant tobe investigated from the perspectives cultural studies.The problems raised in this study are : 1) the representation of the Divine and human beingimagery in the entity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza, 2) the representation of the relationhip between the Divineand human being in ritual practices of Sa’o Ngaza, and 3) the meaning of the representation of theDivine and human being imagery in the entity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza. This study applies the qualitativemethod and the data collection was done using techniques of intensive interview, participationobservation,and documentation. The data were analyzed using the theory of ritus, the theory ofprocess,the theory of semiotics, and the theory of deconstruction.The findings of the study can be explained as follows. Firstly, the representation of theDivine imagery is dyadic and triadic. In the dyadic imagery representation, The Divine is depicted as’The Giver of an Unlimited Love and at the same time as ’The Unpredictable Taker of Love’. In thetriadic representation, The Divine is depicted as The Sacred, in the attributive as ‘The Beginning’,‘The End’, and ‘The Present Throughout’. In the dyadic imagery, the human being consists of theelements of the body and the soul, and in the triadic imagery, the human being consists of theelements of the body, the psyche, and the spirit.Secondly, the relation between the Divine and human being is representatively revealed inthe ritual practices of legitimating Sa’o Ngaza. This relation centers in the methapor of relationshipbetween the simbolic body dan the religious body, and affirms the status of human being as ’thewrapper of divinity seed’ and ‘His image’.Thirdly, the meaning of the representation of the Divine and human being imagery in theentity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza is sacral , spiritual, and moral. The sacral value pertains to the dinamicrelationship between the human being and the Divine in a sacral way and the sacral place. TheSpiritual value pertains to the relation intra-human being and his spiritual opened and connectedthrough inner feeling with the One Sacral in the strong effort of making the human being perfect.The moral value pertains to a good relationship among human beings themselves in accordance withtheir norms of community.The findings of the study enrich the theory of process about the concept of the Divine fromWhitehead and contrast with the theory of ritus as the choreography of violence from Smedal. In theentity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza, there is a unique concept of human being in the design of ulu palicarvings, which describes the ideology of leadership in the local tradition. The finding of thisconcept can become the model of implementation of the decostruction theory and the semiotictheory which removes and deconstructs binary opposition between the leader (ulu) and the follower(eko).","THE REPRESENTATION OF THE DIVINE AND HUMAN BEING IMAGERY IN THE ENTITY OF RITUS SA’O NGAZA IN GURU SINA, NGADA, FLORES",2012-11-26,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,the representation of the divine and human being imagery in the entity of ritus sao ngaza in guru sina ngada flores this dissertation discusses the representation of the divine and human being imagery in theentity of ritus sao ngaza in the village of guru sina in ngada regency flores the empiricproblems of this dissertasion are connected with the marginalized phenomenon of the local religionthat submerged in the entity of ritus sao ngaza and its ritual practices this probelm is relevant tobe investigated from the perspectives cultural studies the problems raised in this study are   the representation of the divine and human beingimagery in the entity of ritus sao ngaza  the representation of the relationhip between the divineand human being in ritual practices of sao ngaza and  the meaning of the representation of thedivine and human being imagery in the entity of ritus sao ngaza this study applies the qualitativemethod and the data collection was done using techniques of intensive interview participationobservationand documentation the data were analyzed using the theory of ritus the theory ofprocessthe theory of semiotics and the theory of deconstruction the findings of the study can be explained as follows firstly the representation of thedivine imagery is dyadic and triadic in the dyadic imagery representation the divine is depicted asthe giver of an unlimited love and at the same time as the unpredictable taker of love in thetriadic representation the divine is depicted as the sacred in the attributive as the beginningthe end and the present throughout in the dyadic imagery the human being consists of theelements of the body and the soul and in the triadic imagery the human being consists of theelements of the body the psyche and the spirit secondly the relation between the divine and human being is representatively revealed inthe ritual practices of legitimating sao ngaza this relation centers in the methapor of relationshipbetween the simbolic body dan the religious body and affirms the status of human being as thewrapper of divinity seed and his image thirdly the meaning of the representation of the divine and human being imagery in theentity of ritus sao ngaza is sacral  spiritual and moral the sacral value pertains to the dinamicrelationship between the human being and the divine in a sacral way and the sacral place thespiritual value pertains to the relation intrahuman being and his spiritual opened and connectedthrough inner feeling with the one sacral in the strong effort of making the human being perfect the moral value pertains to a good relationship among human beings themselves in accordance withtheir norms of community the findings of the study enrich the theory of process about the concept of the divine fromwhitehead and contrast with the theory of ritus as the choreography of violence from smedal in theentity of ritus sao ngaza there is a unique concept of human being in the design of ulu palicarvings which describes the ideology of leadership in the local tradition the finding of thisconcept can become the model of implementation of the decostruction theory and the semiotictheory which removes and deconstructs binary opposition between the leader ulu and the followereko,23382449,11

Although the women’s representation in the legislature in Bali Province has not achieved the 30% target, the attempts made by women to be legislators should be appreciated. The reason is that such attempts can accelerate the gender equality in politics.

11,"Religious transformation of Seni Dodod taking place at Mekar Wangi Village, SaketiDistrict, Pandeglang Regency, South Banten, Banten Province enriches the analysis of thecommunity cultural pattern based on the art characteristics born and developing in thecommunity. In relation to that, this study describes the cultural phenomenon of religioustransformation as the ideological basis of the pre-modern, modern and postmodern communities.Multidisciplinary qualitative method was employed in this study and the data needed werecollected by in-depth interview, participatory observation and documentation techniques. Thefindings show that the Seni Dodod has the belief or the religion adhered to by the people living atMekar Wangi Village as its religious background. Such a belief affects the relation patternbetween the individuals and their community, nature and God. This is used as the reference inwhat is done in the agricultural process, making Seni Dodod a cult and realizatrion. When thecultural transformation process was taking place, it was found that there was a point of contactbetween traditional arts and modern arts outside the domain of Seni Dodod . Nowadays newcompositions of Seni Dodod have been created functioning as instruments of wedding andkhitanan rituals (khitanan = a feast celebrating a circumcision). The process of acculturation wasformally performed at school by using its compositions as the learning material of art andculture. Its application in its original form and composition was informally inherited throughSeni Dodod studios, the youth and villagers. Its religious meaningfulness was reflected from thecountry life performed by the people living at Mekar Wangi village. Such meaningfulness wasbased on that given by the leaders of pondok pesantren (Muslem boarding school) and on theexplanation clarifying, showing, separating and elaborating seven clauses of Al-Qur’an. Themeaningfulness provided resulted in intactness of movements, the costumes worn, the poem oflutung kasarung , the magic formula or the prayers used. In addition, it was also referred to asMuslim art and culture. It seems that nowadays a shift has taken place as far as its function isconcerned.

11,"Kakebyaran art is a performing art with the Balinese identity; it is not only popular in Bali but also in the other provinces in Indonesia and different parts of the world. In Indonesia, such a performing art is also performed in Mataram City, West Nusa Tenggara. The policy with the jargon “Maju, Religious and Berbudaya” (Being Developed, Religious, and Cultured),  which was issued by the ruler of Mataram City, affirms that the development in Mataram City is oriented toward the Islamic religious values, meaning that the other religious and cultural symbols are reduced. Such a situation has motivated the Balinese ethnic community to develop its art, tradition, and culture in general and the kekebyaran art in particular. Such a phenomenon is a domain of cultural studies which is very interesting to be explored in depth. There are three problems related to such a phenomenon. They are 1) the form and function of the reproduction of the kekebyaran art, 2) the factors contributing to the reproduction of the kekebyaran , 3) the impact of the reproduction of the kekebyaran art on and its meaning to the society of Mataram City, West Nusa Tenggara. The present study was conducted using the qualitative method, in accordance with the scientific norm and paradigm of cultural studies. Three theories were used to analyze such problems; they are the theory of cultural reproduction, the theory of identity, and the theory of semiotics. They were eclectically used to discuss the substance of the topic of discussion. The results of analysis were formulated as follows: first, the form of the reproduction of the kekebyaran art is made up of musicality, the instrumental form, the way of presenting it, its function as part of a ritual and a performing art, and its function to strengthen the local culture. Second, the factors contributing to the reproduction of the kakebyaran art are as follows:  the culture, economy and cultural communication. Third, the impact and meaning of the reproduction of the kakebyaran art are as follows:  the spiritual impact, the socio-cultural impact, the economic impact, the aesthetic meaning, and the cultural meaning.","REPRODUCTION OF KAKEBYARAN ART IN MATARAM CITY, WEST NUSA TENGGARA",2016-05-01,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,reproduction of kakebyaran art in mataram city west nusa tenggara kakebyaran art is a performing art with the balinese identity it is not only popular in bali but also in the other provinces in indonesia and different parts of the world in indonesia such a performing art is also performed in mataram city west nusa tenggara the policy with the jargon maju religious and berbudaya being developed religious and cultured which was issued by the ruler of mataram city affirms that the development in mataram city is oriented toward the islamic religious values meaning that the other religious and cultural symbols are reduced such a situation has motivated the balinese ethnic community to develop its art tradition and culture in general and the kekebyaran art in particular such a phenomenon is a domain of cultural studies which is very interesting to be explored in depth there are three problems related to such a phenomenon they are  the form and function of the reproduction of the kekebyaran art  the factors contributing to the reproduction of the kekebyaran   the impact of the reproduction of the kekebyaran art on and its meaning to the society of mataram city west nusa tenggara the present study was conducted using the qualitative method in accordance with the scientific norm and paradigm of cultural studies three theories were used to analyze such problems they are the theory of cultural reproduction the theory of identity and the theory of semiotics they were eclectically used to discuss the substance of the topic of discussion the results of analysis were formulated as follows first the form of the reproduction of the kekebyaran art is made up of musicality the instrumental form the way of presenting it its function as part of a ritual and a performing art and its function to strengthen the local culture second the factors contributing to the reproduction of the kakebyaran art are as follows the culture economy and cultural communication third the impact and meaning of the reproduction of the kakebyaran art are as follows the spiritual impact the sociocultural impact the economic impact the aesthetic meaning and the cultural meaning,23382449,11

In the local level such as in Bangli Regency, Bali Province, the fight among political actors on the printed mass media took place when the general election to vote for the regent was held. The general election which was held to vote for the regent was full of dynamism in which the candidates fought against one another on the longer mass media. The problems of the present study are as follows: (1) what was the fight among political actors on the printed media when the general election was held to vote the regent of Bangli Regency in 2010 like?; (2) the factors leading to it?; and (3) what was the impact and meaning of the fight among the political actors on the printed media? The theories used in the present study were the theory of discourse of relation of knowledge and power, the theory of the impact of media such as the agenda setting, the theory of framing, the theory of media text analysis, the theory of hegemony, and the theory of capital. The research method used was the qualitative approach with critical paradigm.  The forms of the fight among political actors took place in the arenas of news articles, advertorials, advertisements, and paid articles.

11,"During the pre-colonial era the Balinese arts and design were dominated by the themes of puppetry which contained the Hindu religious teachings. When the Dutch colonial government controlled Bali, the Balinese arts and design changed. This present study is intended to explore the existence of the Pitamaha association and the attitude of the Pitamaha painters towards the domination of the modern arts and design taught by Spies and Bonnet. The qualitative method and the postcolonial theory combined with various other critical supporting theories were used in the present study. The result of the study shows that Pitamaha is the first modern association of arts in Bali. However, Pitamaha still integrated the pattern of the Balinese traditional association. In this association, the royal elites were involved as the mediators between Spies and Bonnet and the Balinese painters. Spies and Bonnet taught the modern arts which were different from and even contrasted with the Balinese arts and design. However, the Pitamaha painters welcome it. This could not be separated from the practice of teaching through hegemony and domination which contrasted with what had been desired by the Balinese painters who intended to maintain the Balinese arts and design. In such an ambivalent condition, they mimed the modern arts and design. The mimicry made was not intended to mime the modern arts and design; instead, the mimicry made was intended to interpret with reference to the norms of the Balinese arts and design.",PITAMAHA: MIMICRY IN ARTS AND DESIGN  DURING THE COLONIAL ERA,2016-02-01,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,pitamaha mimicry in arts and design  during the colonial era during the precolonial era the balinese arts and design were dominated by the themes of puppetry which contained the hindu religious teachings when the dutch colonial government controlled bali the balinese arts and design changed this present study is intended to explore the existence of the pitamaha association and the attitude of the pitamaha painters towards the domination of the modern arts and design taught by spies and bonnet the qualitative method and the postcolonial theory combined with various other critical supporting theories were used in the present study the result of the study shows that pitamaha is the first modern association of arts in bali however pitamaha still integrated the pattern of the balinese traditional association in this association the royal elites were involved as the mediators between spies and bonnet and the balinese painters spies and bonnet taught the modern arts which were different from and even contrasted with the balinese arts and design however the pitamaha painters welcome it this could not be separated from the practice of teaching through hegemony and domination which contrasted with what had been desired by the balinese painters who intended to maintain the balinese arts and design in such an ambivalent condition they mimed the modern arts and design the mimicry made was not intended to mime the modern arts and design instead the mimicry made was intended to interpret with reference to the norms of the balinese arts and design,23382449,11
