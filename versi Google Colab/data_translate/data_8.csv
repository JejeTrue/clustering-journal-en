8,"As a district that has a fairly large coastal area, Karawang has considerable potential in producing fishery products. One of the leading fish commodities in Karawang Regency is the Manyung fish (Arius thalassinus) which is usually processed into jambal roti salted fish. One of the problems in the traditional processing of jambal roti salted fish is the lack of attention to aspects of sanitation and hygiene, so that the product is easily damaged. Misuse of preservatives from hazardous chemicals such as formalin is still widely found to overcome this problem. This study aimed to identify the presence of formalin content qualitatively in samples of jambal roti salted fish marketed in traditional markets and online markets in Karawang Regency. Jambal roti salted fish samples were obtained randomly (simple random sampling) from traders in five different traditional markets and five samples were obtained from online markets in Karawang Regency.

A good child's independence increases the ability to solve problems including health problems. Dental caries is a disease of oral tissue that affects many children. Dental caries can cause malnutrition and interfere with children's growth. The study aims to determine the relationship between parenting applied by parents with the independence of children and the severity of children's dental caries. The study involved 120 pairs of respondents of primary-school-age mothers and children in the working area of the Srondol health center selected based on Multi-stage sampling. The cross-sectional study design and data collected through interviews included the type of parenting, the level of independence of the child, and the severity of caries based on the results of the caries depth foundation. Data analysis uses the Spearman Rank Correlation test and the Strong Estimate (OR) relationship. The results of the study: independence level is very independent 43.3%. Most of the parents' respondents applied the democratic parenting approach which was 42.5%). The severity of media caries suffered the most by child respondents (46.7%). There is a relationship between parenting patterns of the child's level of independence (p = 0,000 and rho = 0.407) and the better the parenting category the better the level of children's independence. There is a relationship between parents and the severity of children's dental caries (p = 0,000 and rho=-0,376) The better the parenting category, the lower the severity of dental caries in children. There is a relationship between children's independence and caries severity (p = 0,000 and rho = -0,668). So from the research, it was concluded that there was a relationship between the pattern of parenting with the child's independence and the severity of the child's dental caries.","CORRELATIONS BETWEEN PARENTING STYLE WITH THE CHILD INDEPENDENCE AND THE SEVERITY LEVELS OF DENTAL CARIES IN SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN (Study Of Elementary School Students In The Work Area Of Srondol Health Center, Banyumanik District, Semarang City)",2020-11-02,JURNAL KESEHATAN MASYARAKAT,parenting is a series of interactions with children the right parenting becomes a factor that determines children's independence a good child's independence increases the ability to solve problems including health problems dental caries is a disease of oral tissue that affects many children dental caries can cause malnutrition and interfere with children's growth the study aims to determine the relationship between parenting applied by parents with the independence of children and the severity of children's dental caries the study involved pairs of respondents of primary school mothers and children in the working area of ​​the srondol health center selected based on multistage sampling the crosssectional study design and data collected through interviews included the type of parenting the level of independence of the child and the severity of caries based on the results of the caries depth foundation data analysis using the spearman rank correlation test and the strong estimate or relationship the results of the study independence level is very independent most of the parents respondents applied the democratic parenting approach which was the severity of media caries suffered the most by child respondents there is a relationship between parenting patterns of the child's level of independence p and rho and the better the parenting category the better the level of children's independence there is a relationship between parents and the severity of children's dental caries p and rho the better the parenting category the lower the severity of dental caries in children there is a relationship between children's independence and caries severity p and rho so from the research it was concluded that there was a relationship between the pattern of parenting with the child's independence and the severity of the child's dental caries,23563346,8

8,"Diseases related to lipid metabolism continue to be a worldwide concern. Abnormal levels of lipids, especially Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) can cause cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes. Until now, these two diseases are the main causes of death globally according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition to pharmacological therapy such as statins, lipid levels can also be lowered through exercise. Therefore, this review article aims to provide information about the types of exercise that can reduce blood lipid levels according to the conditions of individual groups in terms of age, gender, and other special groups based on certain disease conditions. It was found that the most widely practiced exercise in all individual groups was aerobic exercise. This exercise is suitable for pregnant and postmenopausal women. Concurrent training is also appropriate for postmenopausal women. Whereas in premenopausal women, water exercise is more effective than concurrent training. In adult men, an effective exercise to do is the nordic walk. In the elderly, exercise that can be done is stationary cycling with one leg at high intensity. Patients with special conditions with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can perform coordination and strength exercises.

8,"Immunization programs have proven to be effective and efficient in providing health services, but in practice, many challenges are still encountered, among them those related to achieving immunization targets and improving immunization services. The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed Indonesia's national health system by digitizing health data. In the immunization program, in 2022, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia launched the SehatIndonesiaKu (ASIK) application as a national Electronic Immunization Register (EIR). Readiness assessment needs to be carried out on the application of national RIE so that it is optimal. This study aims to explore readiness for implementing national EIR in Banten and North Maluku Provinces. This is a descriptive study using a qualitative design with the Rapid Assessment Procedures (RAP) method. Research informants are immunization program managers in Banten and North Maluku Provinces. The instruments used for data collection were screening questionnaires, FGD guidelines, interview questionnaires, and observation sheets. Information about the readiness to implement national RIE was obtained through focus group discussions (FGD) and interview discussions during site visits. The data was then analyzed qualitatively. The content analysis process used to determine codes, categories, and themes in this study uses OpenCode 4.02 software. The readiness to implement national EIR in terms of organizational culture can be seen from the acceptance of ASIK as a national EIR and the adoption strategies chosen in the two provinces. In the aspect of management and leadership, maintenance of the quality of immunization data has been carried out through monitoring, confirmation, validation, and evaluation. The readiness of the operational aspect can be seen from the implementation of ASIK, which began with national piloting for the implementation of BIAN 2022, followed by ASIK piloting for routine immunization in several selected provinces, one of which is in North Maluku Province.

This research aims to analyze the effect of cadre training on stunting prevention in toddler. This type of research is Quasy-Experimental with unequal control group design. The research sample consisted of 64 posyandu cadres taken using purposive techniques according to inclusion criteria. The training used counseling methods, giving a stunting cadre guidebook, and two weeks of field practice. The result of Wilcoxon test analysis in the experimental group after the training gives differences in knowledge (p=0,000), self-efficacy (p=0.002), and practice (p=0,000). While attitudes do not produce a difference (p=0.182). Although there was no change in attitude, it happened because posyandu cadres showed a positive attitude about stunting before the training was conducted. An increase in knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and practice after the intervention shows that the stimulus can be received effectively, so that it influences attention, then there is a willingness to act, and forming beliefs in individuals that have an impact on actualizing actions or changing behavior. In the control group there were no differences in knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and practices in the pre-test and post-test (p>0.05). The Mann Whitney test in the both groups produced differences in knowledge and practice with values (p=0,000).
