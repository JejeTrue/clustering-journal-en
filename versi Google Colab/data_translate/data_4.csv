4,"Corporate governance merupakan isu yang sedang hangat dibicarakan&nbsp;sebagai suatu alat yang bisa memecahkan masalah dalam pengelolaan dan&nbsp;pertanggungjawaban perusahaan modern. Corporate governance adalah&nbsp;serangkaian mekanisme yang digunakan untuk membatasi timbulnya&nbsp;masalah keagenan (Ariyoto, 2000). Salah satu hal yang menyebabkan&nbsp;timbulnya masalah keagenan adalah adanya asimetri informasi antara agen&nbsp;dan prinsipal perusahaan.&nbsp;Di sisi lain, kemungkinan dilakukannya manajemen laba akan meningkat&nbsp;seiring dengan meningkatnya asimetri informasi (Dye ,1988 dan Trueman&nbsp;dan Titman (1988). Dengan demikian, bisa dikatakan bahwa corporate&nbsp;governance akan mampu mengurangi manajemen laba yang dilakukan&nbsp;oleh manajemen perusahaan.&nbsp;Penelitian ini bertujuan menguji pengaruh praktik-praktik corporate governance&nbsp;dalam suatu perusahaan terhadap praktik manajemen laba&nbsp;melalui akrual diskresioner. Penelitian ini berbeda dengan penelitian&nbsp;sebelumnya dalam hal pengukuran variabel corporate governance yang&nbsp;lebih komprehensif. Mekanisme corporate governance yang diuji dalam&nbsp;penelitian ini adalah komitmen perusahaan terhadap corporate governance,&nbsp;pelaksanaan RUPS dan perlakuan terhadap pemegang saham&nbsp;minoritas, kualitas dewan komisaris, kualitas dewandireksi, kualitas&nbsp;hubungan perusahaan dengan stakeholders, transparansi dan&nbsp;akuntabilitas, dan kepemilikan saham perusahaan oleh investor&nbsp;institusional.&nbsp;Penelitian dilakukan dengan menggunakan sampel sebanyak 34&nbsp;perusahaan yang terdaftar di Bursa Efek Jakarta. Perusahaan yang&nbsp;digunakan sebagai sampel penelitian adalah perusahaan yang bukan&nbsp;berasal dari indusiri perbankan dan keuangan. Dengan menggunakan&nbsp;alat statistik regresi berganda, penelitian ini berhasil menemukan&nbsp;bahwa salah satu mekanisme corporate governance, yaitu kualitas&nbsp;hubungan perusahaan dengan stakehoder, berhubungan negatif&nbsp;dengan praktik manajemen laba. Peneliti belum berhasil menemukan&nbsp;hubungan negatif antara mekanisme corporate governance, selain&nbsp;kualitas hubungan perusahaan dengan stakeholders, dengan&nbsp;manajemen laba.&nbsp;Penelitian ini juga berhasil menemukan adanya hubungan positif antara&nbsp;leverage keuangan dengan manajemen laba.

Another result shows that smoothers who have good performance have lower discretionary accruals than those who do not have good performance. This result contradicts the logic that&nbsp;smoothers will have more discretionary accruals to achieve their purpose&nbsp;of income smoothing. The logical explanation of this result is that non-performing companies try to cover their performance by&nbsp;using higher discretionary accruals, especially in the period of crisis.

This study shows that there is a significant positive relationship between job satisfaction and organizational commitment.

Balanced scorecard meninjau peningkatan kinerja sebuah organisasi dari empat perspektif yaitu financial, costumer, internal bisnis dan pertumbuhan dan pembelajaran. Dan organisasi sektor publik dapat menggunakan pengukuran kinerja ini karena memang dalam pengukuran aspek financialnya mengalami kendala. Dalam prakteknya penerapan konsep Balance Scorecard ini tidaklah semudah yang diperkirakan karean penerpan konsep ini membutuhkan suatu komitmen dari manajemen pusat maupun karyawan yang terlibat dalam organisasi.

The balanced scorecard reviews the improvement of an organization's performance from four perspectives, namely financial, customer, internal, business and growth and learning. Public sector organizations can use this performance measurement because in measuring the financial aspect, there are obstacles in practice. The application of the balanced scorecard concept is not as easy as expected because the application of this concept requires a commitment from central management and employees involved in the organization. From the opinions of experts, one of whom is Mavrinac, most companies or organizations find it difficult to detect the alignment of company activities and strategies with the goals to be achieved by the organization in the long term. Therefore, if it is indeed going to be applied in a public sector organization whose organization is structured from the center to the regions, it requires a high level of understanding and commitment in its application.",26569124,4

4,"Korupsi di Indonesia bagaikan penyakit yang mengerikan. Keberadaannya telah merusak seluruh sendi kehidupan, hingga menimbulkan krisis berkepanjangan. Namun kekuatan untuk menghentikannya tidaklah lebih besar dari daya pendorong timbulnya korupsi, karena korupsi telah merasuk dalam kehidupan sebagian besar masyarakat dari tingkatan yang paling bawah samapai elit politik. Oleh karena itu pada tataran makro, korupsi telah menjadi budaya masyarakat. Berangkat dari sinilah kajian korupsi banyak mengambil sisi etika, budaya dan moral. Sementar itu kurang memperhatikan kajian dari fenomena ekonomi. Kajian dari sisi ekonomi bukan untuk mengganti berbagai kajian seperti disebutkan di atas, namun bersifat melengkapi. Menurut penulis, adanya upah di bawah standar atau tidak&nbsp;comparable&nbsp; menimbulkan perasaan&nbsp;underpayment.&nbsp; Inilah salah satu landasan untuk melakukan korupsi. Korupsi menimbulkan biaya keagenan (agency cost)&nbsp;yang tidak dapat diperhitungkan besarnya. Dimana korupsi merupakan upaya mebcari keuntungan pribadi para pemegang kendali manajemen dengan beban ditanggung organisasi. Dalam kajian mikro, motif ekonomi dari individu lebih menonjol. Korupsi bukan budaya, melainkan kasus yang dilatarbelakangi ketidakadilan (inequity)&nbsp;yang tidak segera diselesaikan sampai sumbernya. Korupsi merupakan sebuah reaksi kompromistis dari adanya rasa&nbsp;inequity,&nbsp;karena tidak sanggup menolak ketidakadilan tersebut. Teori equity tampaknya dapat menjelaskan timbulnya korupsi tersebut. Sementara itu teori keagenan mampu menjelaskan konflik antara prinsipal dan agennya serta struktur pengendalian manajemen yang diperlukan. Korupsi timbul karena tidak adanya monitor dan pengendalian yang memadai dalam menjalankan kewenangan yang diberikan oleh prinsipal.

4,"Proses audit atas laporan keuangan dilaksanakan oleh auditor melalui empat tahap utama yaitu: perencanaan, pemahaman, pengujian struktur pengendalian interen serta penerbitan laporan audit (Mulyadi dan Kanaka, 1998). Dalam membuat laporan audit seseorang auditor harus mempertimbangkan beberapa permasalahan yaitu materialitas, resiko dan judgment. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England dan Wales (1996) menyatakan suatu persoalan dikatakan materialitas jika tidak adanya pengungkapan atas salah saji material atau kelalaian dari suatu account dapat mengubah pandangan yang diberikan terhadap laporan keuangan. Materialitas berhubungan dengan judgment, ketika dikaitkan dengan cara evaluasi resiko pertimbangan inilah yang akan mempengaruhi cara-cara pencapaian tujuan audit, ruang lingkup dan arah pekerjaan terperinci serta disposisi kesalahan dan kelalaian (Taylor, 2000). Sedangkan resiko menunjukkan tingkat resiko kegagalan auditor untuk mengubah pendapat atas laporan keuangan yang sebenarnya berisis salah saji material. Hubungan judgment didasari oleh dua konsep yaitu konsep resiko dan konsep materialitas dan dikaitkan dengan laporan keuangan judgment yang diputuskan dengan mempertimbangkan dua konsep tersebut akan berpengaruh kepada opini auditor mengenai kewajaran laporan keuangan.

Mulyadi and Kanaka in making an audit report, an auditor must consider several problems, namely materiality, risk and judgment. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales states that a problem is said to be material if there is no disclosure of material misstatements or omissions from an account that can change the view given to the financial statements. Materiality is related to judgment when associated with the method of evaluating risk. This consideration will affect the methods of achieving audit objectives, the scope and direction of detailed work and the disposition of errors and omissions. Taylor, while risk indicates the level of risk of the auditor's failure to change the opinion on the financial statements that actually contain material misstatements. The relationship between judgment is based on two concepts, namely the concept of risk and the concept of materiality and is associated with financial statements. Judgment that is decided by considering these two concepts will affect the auditor's opinion regarding the fairness of the financial statements. Ponemon and Ghabart Shaub and Lawrence and Windsor and Ashkanasy in Laowers et al where the results of the study showed the same results that moral judgment had a significant effect on auditor independence.

4,"Fenomena yang selalu terjadi berulang secara tahunan atas komoditi semen Indonesia adalah sering hilangnya produk ini di pasar yang disusul dengan naik harga. Kendatipun alasan klasik yang sering dikemukakan adalah karena pengaruh musim dan kenaikan biaya produksi akibat penyesuaian harga BBM dan listrik, namun tetap saja tersimoan suatu pertanyaan. Adakah suatu penyebab, yang sesungguhnya adalah akar dari persoalan tersebut? Dengan maksud untuk menjawab pertanyaan tersebut, penelitian ini dilakukan. Pendekatan yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Ekonomi Industri. Dengan menggunakan alat analisis&nbsp;Concentration Ratio (CR4) dan Indeks Linda, penelitian ini diarahkan untuk mengungkap tiga aspek utama dalam industri semen, yakni struktur (structure),&nbsp;perilaku (conduct),&nbsp; dan kinerja (performance).&nbsp;Sedangkan data yang digunakan adalah informasi tentang pangsa pasar perusahaan-perusahaan semen yang ada dalam pasar semen Indonesia dalam kurun waktu 1998-2001. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa struktur pasar industri semen Indonesia bercorak oligopoli. Hal ini ditunjukkan dengan sedikitnya perusahaan yang beroperasi dalam pasar sebagai pemain utama (5-7 perusahaan). Corak pasar yang demikian semakin nyata dengan temuan tingkat konsentrasi empat perusahaan dengan pangsa terbesar (CR4) yang berkisar antara 75-85 persen. Mencermati perkembangan jumlah perusahaan yang beroperasi sebagai pemain utama dan angka rasio konsentrasi, ditemukan pula bahwa tingkat persaingan dalam pasar industri ini semakintidak kompetitif. Struktur pasar seperti dijelaskan di atas pada kenyataannya telah mendorong perusahaan-perusahaan semen untuk melakukan kartel di antara mereka melalui Asosiasi Semen Indonesia (ASI). Dengan kartel ini selanjutnya mereka melakukan pengaturan tingkat produksi dan pada gilirannya hal yang sama dilakukan pula terhadap harga. Maka tak mengherankan jika harga semen selalu meningkat meskipun penetapan harga ini ditentukan oleh pemerintah. Disisi lain, kenaikan harga ini juga dipicu oleh tingkat produksi perusahaan semen yang masih di bawah kapasitas produksinya.

4,"Historically, it was believed that dual role (i.e. the individual as professional and also involve in managerial role) can potentially have adverse consequences through the creation of role conflict. Comerford and Abernethy’s (1999) finding revealed that the individuals with a high professional orientation will experience less adverse consequences (i.e. lower role conflict) when involved in the budgeting process provided that they have taken on a system goal orientation. As such, this field study reexamines this professional-managerial role conflict with the different subject. Besides, this study is extended by looking at the moderating effect of perceived fairness on the relationship between professional orientation and role conflict. The result of this study was not consistent with those indicated by prior empirical research which showed that goal system orientation had a direct effect on the relationship between professional orientation and role conflict. This finding, however, support the contemporary perspective, which suggest that occupational commitment and organizational commitment are positively, not negatively associated.

4,"The relationship between budgetary participation and budgetary slack and relationship between job involvement and budgetary slack has been examined in several&nbsp; accounting studies with conflicting results. The conflicting evidence may reflect the influence of a contingent variable. This study examined influence of organizational commitment as moderating variable in the relationship between budgetary participation and budgetary slack, and influence of organizational commitment as moderating variable in the relationship between job involvement and budgetary slack. This study provides empirical evidence that motivational factors of organizational commitment, job involvement and budgetary participation might be important factor in explaining managers propensities to create budgetary slack. The results indicate that for highly commited managers, budgetary participation is associated with decreased prospensity to create budgetary slack. For managers who have low levels of commitment to organization’s goals and values, budgetary participation is associated with increased propensity to create budgetary slack.

4,"Filsafat ilmu merupakan salah satu cabang filsafat yang telah banyak digunakan oleh pakar ekonomi dan akuntansi untuk mengembangkan baik teori ekonomi maupun akuntansi. Pada awalnya pengembangan teori akuntansi didasarkan pada praktek. Seiring dengan perkembangan tuntutan bisnis terhadap akuntansi, selanjutnya teori akuntansi dikembangkan dengan pendekatan normative descriptive. Pendekatan terakhir tersebut banyak dinilai tidak ilmiah, kemudian teori akuntansi dikembangkan dengan mendasarkan diri pada teori akuntansi positif. Aliran positif telah banyak mendapatkan kritik, diantaranya positivisme telah menyebabkan ilmu berkembang dengan pesat sampai melupakan induk filsafatnya serta aliran positif dianggap memaksakan kehendak peneliti dengan merekayasa data agar normal. Mulailah berkembang paham critical yang telah menekankan pada kebebasan metodologi dan sejarah untuk mendapatkan teori yang holistik, tetapi baru diakui positivism telah terbukti mampu mengembangkan ilmu dan tehnologi seperti yang ada pada saat ini. Dengan demikian paham critical tepat sebagai pembanding dan pelengkap paham positivisme (Hadi, 1999). Hubungan antara filsafat, ilmu ekonomi, dan akuntansi didasarkan pada masalah yang dihadapi dalam pengembangan teori akuntansi yaitu berbagai konsep atau pengertian lain yang diambil dari mainstream teori akuntansi, sementara banyak teoritisi akuntansi pada awalnya memiliki pengetahuan ilmu ekonomi seperti, Devine (1961) dan Chambers (1977).

A number of accounting literatures state that the nature of accounting as a science can be approached from the perspective of the philosophy of science. Philosophy of science states that the role of philosophy of science as a foundation in the development of accounting is very large. This paper aims to examine the contribution of philosophy of science as a foundation for the development of accounting science from time to time. In particular, the study focuses on three main aspects of philosophy of science, namely the axiology aspect, epistemology and ontology. In addition to these three aspects, the ethical and heuristic aspects are also studied. The results of the study show that philosophy of science plays an important role as the main foundation in the development and extension of accounting theory. From the ontological aspect, philosophy of science plays a role as the main foundation in the formulation of postulates or basic assumptions of accounting. From the epistemological aspect, philosophy of science plays a crucial role as the main foundation in determining and formulating exemplars or objects of knowledge. Images of the main issues, theories, methods, principles, standards and instruments of accounting. From the axiological aspect, philosophy of science plays an important role in directing the goals and objectives of the final objectives of the accounting science development process for interested parties. From the ethical aspect, philosophy of science also plays a role as the main foundation in providing ethical aspects. and morals in the development of norms and codes of ethics for accounting practices and audits as well as disclosure and accountability of accounting information from the heuristic aspect of the philosophy of science plays a role as a foundation for accounting theorists to consider and adopt a number of paradigms from other scientific disciplines to answer the various complexities of problems that accounting is currently facing and will face today.

Variabel tersebut baru merupakan signal yang nyata pengaruhnya ketika melalui prakualifikasi penjamin emisi sebagai variabel intervening atau baru menjadi signifikan sewaktu dikaitkan pengaruhnya terhadap prakualifikasi penjamin emisi dan tingkat kembalain awal saham paska penawarn umum perdana. Berdasarkan hasil uji analisis faktor, maka variabel umur perusahaan dan variabel umur perusahaan dan variabel ukuran perusahaan dinyatakan memenuhi syarat sebagai indikator dari variabel assurance. Upaya assurance yang dilakukan oleh emiten melalui prakualifikasi penjamin emisi berpengaruh signifikan terhadap return awal paska penawaran umum perdana. Dengan demikian penelitian ini dapat merumuskan dan membuktikan bahwa sebagai intervening variabel, prakualifikasi penjamin emisi terbukti berperan positip mengurangi tejadinya asimetri informasi dengan cara menjembatani dan memperkuat assurance perusahaan pada pasar. Pada paska penawaran umum perdana return awal saham yang tercipta dalam jangka pendek terbukti lebih besar dari return jangka panjang (satu tahun) sesudah penawaran umum perdana. Dengan demikian hasil peneliatan ini memperkuat pernyataan bahwa konsep return pada penawaran umum perdana lebih merupakan fenomena jangka pendek.

Assurance has a very important meaning when there is information asymmetry in the relationship between the issuer, underwriter and investor. The development of the model in the study places the underwriter prequalification variable as an intervening variable in relation to the relationship between the issuer and investors in the initial public offering event. The relationship between the issuer and the underwriter in the initial public offering process can create information asymmetry. Further information asymmetry will harm investors. Investors need assurance that the stock price in the secondary market after listing does not fall lower than the purchase price in the primary market. This study was conducted at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (BEJ) on companies that have held an initial public offering process within a period of time. The structural equation modeling method is used for the analysis of the interests of analyzing the relationship between variables directly and indirectly. This study tries to reveal the influence of assurance variables in the form of company age and company size on underwriter prequalification and initial stock returns after the initial public offering. The company size variable through underwriter prequalification has a significant effect on the level of initial stock returns after the initial public offering. The bigger the company, the more uncertainty there is. low and the return is also relatively low and vice versa the variable of company age through underwriter prequalification has a significant effect on the initial return of shares after the initial public offering the longer the age of the company means the more experienced it is in anticipating the possibilities that occur the implication for companies that are not yet old need to synergize with companies that are old when they intend to hold an IPO the results of this study can formulate and prove that the variables of company age and company size are indirect category signaling variables these variables are only real signals that have an effect when through underwriter prequalification as intervening variables or only become significant when their effect is linked to underwriter prequalification and the initial return of shares after the initial public offering based on the results of the factor analysis test, the variable of company age and the variable of company age and the variable of company size are declared to meet the requirements as indicators of the assurance variable assurance efforts made by issuers through underwriter prequalification have a significant effect on the initial return after the initial public offering thus this study can formulate and prove that as an intervening variable underwriter prequalification has been proven to play a positive role in reducing the occurrence of information asymmetry by bridging and strengthening the company's assurance in the market after the initial public offering return The initial stock returns created in the short term are proven to be greater than the long-term returns one year after the initial public offering, thus the results of this study strengthen the statement that the concept of returns on initial public offerings is more of a short-term phenomenon. The implication is that it is necessary to improve good governance in the development of the stock exchange to move towards an efficient capital market.",26569124,4

4,"The paper discusses previous studies on the effect of fatigue among flight crews and their effect on airline businesses. Fatigue is a major concern in flight operations as many reports were issued on this problem among flight crew. The long flight duration requires them to travel several time zones, which leads to fatigue. Furthermore, the change of time zones could also lead to the occurrence of jet lag and subsequently causes fatigue too. Fatigue can occur during and after the travelling period, and it takes a while to recover from it. This study aims to observe the effects of fatigue experienced by flight crew. The results show that fatigue causes many health problems such as an increase in cancer risk, depression, mental illness and miscarriage. Additionally, fatigue reduces one's work productivity as working in a tired state reduces work performance. Furthermore, fatigue also leads to other problems such as anger, anxiety, stress and job dissatisfaction. With the studies conducted on the issue of fatigue, airlines should take appropriate actions to minimise or solve the problem to ensure that fatigue problem will not affect flight crew performance and the airline business.",FLIGHT CREW FATIGUE AND THE EFFECT ON AIRLINE BUSINESS,2021-06-30,JURNAL BISNIS DAN AKUNTANSI,flight crew fatigue and the effect on airline business the paper discusses previous studies on the effect of fatigue among flight crews and their effect on airline businesses fatigue is a major concern in flight operations as many reports were issued on this problem among flight crew the long flight duration requires them to travel several time zones which leads to fatigue furthermore the change of time zones could also lead to the occurrence of jet lag and afterward causes fatigue too fatigue can occur during and after the traveling period and it takes a while to recover from it this study aims to observe the effects of fatigue experienced by the flight crew results show that fatigue causes many health problems such as an increase in cancer risk depression mental illness and miscarriage additionally fatigue reduces ones work productivity as working in a tired state reduces work performance furthermore fatigue also leads to other problems such as anger anxiety stress and job dissatisfaction with the studies conducted on the issue of fatigue airlines should take appropriate actions to minimize or solve the problem to ensure that fatigue problem will not affect flight crew performance and the airline business,26569124,4

4,"This study investigates the effect of the board of directors (BOD) diversity on dividend policy and how the implications of profitability are treated as moderation. Dividend policy and BOD characteristics have been studied extensively; however, the profitability role being moderating variable and BOD diversity are challenging. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first to examine profitability as moderation. BOD diversity includes gender, age, education level, accounting expertise, and nationality. The research period spanned 2017-2020, where the number of samples was 370 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, resulting in 1,480 data. The regression model used is panel data. Overall, BOD gender, education level, and nationality are homogeneous, where female directors, directors with master's education, and foreign directors have a small proportion. As a result, they have no significant effect in promoting dividends. In addition, profitability cannot influence the relationship between board gender and board nationality on dividends. Nevertheless, profitability moderates the relationship between board nationality and dividend policy to a significant negative. Further, board age and accounting expertise positively and significantly affect dividend policy, and the results are identical when moderated by profitability. The proportion of board expertise expressed is heterogeneous, and the board age of 52 years is categorized as old, while they mitigate agency conflict. Thus, companies are required to maintain these proportions. However, companies must remedy the recruitment system to accommodate more female directors, directors with higher education at the master's level, and foreign directors. The government must also refer to regulations in developed and developing countries that establish a minimum quota for the presence of female directors.",Can Board Diversity Promote Dividend Policy?

4,"This paper examines the relationship between financial performance and Annual Readability Reporting. This study is interesting in that companies should submit reports concisely and are easy to read. However, it turns out that many company managers submit management reports in many sentences, especially when financial performance is not in good condition. An interesting finding of this paper is that net income has a significant negative effect on ARR, which indicates that even when management earns profits, the language of reporting submissions by management is quite difficult for users of financial statements to read. This study uses 66 years of observation of companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and tests the hypothesis using multiple linear regression and correlation. The results show that companies with high ARR with higher financial performance. Service companies in Indonesia need to convey their performance using more words, especially when financial conditions are not good. As measured by ROA, excellent financial performance significantly influences the readability of annual financial statements. The implications of this research are mainly for the service sector, there is a management behavior that has a habit of saying more words even though the profit is positive.

4,"Working capital decisions are important for financing the operations of manufacturing companies, especially during a pandemic which indicates a decline in working capital. This study aims to examine the effect of working capital (Net Working Capital - NWC) on the profitability of manufacturing companies on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) during non-pandemic and pandemic conditions covid-19, as well as testing the moderating effect of financial constraint. The sample is determined by technique purposive sampling for manufacturing companies from 2018-2021 and analyzed with moderation regression. Results do not confirm Resource-Based Theory where working capital has a significant negative effect on profitability because high working capital creates additional costs that can reduce profits. In addition, the data shows that each sub-sector has different characteristics in terms of working capital requirements and profit-generating capabilities. There are sub-sectors with low (high) working capital that have high (low) profitability. This negative direction of working capital and profits continued until the pandemic conditions, of course, several sub-sectors experienced a decline in profitability. This study also shows that there is no moderating effect financial constraint, but financial constraint has a significant positive effect on profitability. The lower financial constraint, the company's profits continued to decline which could be due to the company's less than optimal management of available funds. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are unconfirmed Resource-Based Theory due to differences in sub-sector and company characteristics.

4,"The pharmaceutical industry has emerged as one of the most rapidly expanding sectors globally, and this trend holds true for Indonesia as well. Within this industry, a notably popular type of medication in Indonesia is herbal medicine. This variant of medicine is derived from traditional and natural ingredients, with minimal incorporation of chemical substances. To delve into this phenomenon, the present study aims to identify the factors influencing Indonesians' inclination and intention to purchase herbal medicine. To achieve this, the study integrates key variables from the original Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) framework, namely attitude and subjective norm, along with an additional element – perceived value. The methodology employed involves a survey-based approach, utilizing questionnaires as the primary data collection tool among the chosen participants. The sampling method chosen is non-probability purposive sampling, ensuring that only individuals who meet the predetermined criteria participate – specifically, individuals who have acquired herbal medicines within the past 6 months.

4,"E-commerce has profoundly altered the shopping behaviors of consumers in Indonesia. Additionally, fintech companies have introduced ""paylater"" services, revolutionizing the payment process for online purchases. Paylater operates on a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) system, allowing consumers to make purchases and defer payment. This innovation enhances the ease and security of online shopping, enticing users with enticing sales promotions. A survey targeting e-commerce users in Indonesia was conducted and subsequently analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM - PLS). Employing a quantitative descriptive approach with a cross-sectional design, data was collected offline over 14 days in DKI Jakarta, Indonesia, yielding a final dataset from 122 respondents out of 210 obtained. Research outcomes revealed that sales promotion, subjective norms, and e-commerce live streaming features significantly influence impulsive buying behavior among consumers. The use of paylater services moderates this relationship, indicating that frequent paylater users tend to exhibit more impulsivity in their purchasing patterns. Despite the convenience offered by paylater services, there are associated risks such as debt accumulation and financial mismanagement. The findings of this research can serve as an educational tool for potential paylater users, encouraging responsible use and financial management. This research substantially contributes to the growth of fintech companies and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), ultimately fostering economic development and providing a reference for future researchers exploring similar topics.","SALES PROMOTION, LIVE STREAMING, SUBJECTIVE NORM TERHADAP IMPULSIVE BUYING DENGAN PAYLATER SEBAGAI VARIABEL MODERASI",2023-12-27,JURNAL BISNIS DAN AKUNTANSI,sales promotion live streaming subjective norm towards impulsive buying with paylater as a moderating variable ecommerce has profoundly altered the shopping behaviors of consumers in Indonesia additionally fintech companies have introduced paylater services revolutionizing the payment process for online purchases paylater operates on a buy now pay later bnpl system allowing consumers to make purchases and defer payments this innovation enhances the ease and security of online shopping enticing users with enticing sales promotions a survey targeting ecommerce users in indonesia was investigated and subsequently analyzed using structural equation modeling sem pls employing a quantitative descriptive approach with a crosssectional design data was collected offline over days in dki jakarta indonesia yielding a final dataset from respondents out of obtained research outcomes revealed that sales promotion subjective norms and ecommerce live streaming features significantly influence impulsive buying behavior among consumers the use of paylater services moderates this relationship indicating that frequent paylater users tend to exhibit more impulsivity in their purchasing patterns despite the convenience offered by paylater services there are associated risks such as debt accumulation and financial mismanagement the findings of this research can serve as an educational tool for potential pay later users responsible encouraging use and financial management this research substantially contributes to the growth of fintech companies and micro small and mediumsized enterprises ultimately fostering economic development and providing a reference for future researchers exploring similar topics,26569124,4
