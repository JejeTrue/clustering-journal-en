9,"Though highly recommended by health organizations worldwide, breastfeeding an infant from birth for a period of several months is not universal. There is thus a need to investigate appropriate and effective means to promote this breastfeeding behavior. This study, rooted in a social marketing perspective, tests the impact of message framing and source credibility on the behavioral intention to breastfeed. A 2 x 2 factorial experiment was conducted in Indonesia, an especially relevant setting given that the percentage of Indonesian women who breastfeed is low compared to other countries. Two hundred and seventy nine pregnant women participated in this study. The findings of this study indicate that the interaction between message framing and source credibility has a significant effect on a person’s attitude and intention to provide exclusive breastfeeding. In addition, this study finds that attitude is an essential determinant of intention.",The Impact of Message Framing and  Source Credibility on Breastfeeding Intention:  A Social Marketing Approach,2014-05-02,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the impact of message framing and source credibility on breastfeeding intention a social marketing approach although highly recommended by health organizations worldwide breastfeeding an infant from birth for a period of several months is not universal there is thus a need to investigate appropriate and effective means to promote this breastfeeding behavior this study rooted in a social marketing perspective tests the impact of message framing and source credibility on the behavioral intention to breastfeed a x factorial experiment was conducted in Indonesia an especially relevant setting given that the percentage of Indonesian women who breastfeed is low compared to other countries two hundred and seventy nine pregnant women participated in this study the findings of this study indicate that the interaction between message framing and source credibility has a significant effect on a person's attitude and intention to provide exclusive breastfeeding in addition this study finds that attitude is an essential determinant of intention,23387238,9
9,"Research on the customer value to an organization has been widely explored, yet most studies only determined on the financial value based on the customer’s purchasing behavior. The value of customers beyond their purchasing behavior –defined as the relational worth - has not been commonly captured yet. This non-financial value is one of the drivers in retaining customers, hence it becomes a crucial factor in preserving the profitability of the organization. For this reason, this paper aims to examine the customer non-financial valuations of a loyalty reward program. The scope of the study covered a reward program involving consumer exertions in the context of a Frequent Flyer Program (FFP) offered by an airline in Indonesia. The hypotheses are empirically tested with a sample of FFP members conducted through an online survey (n=475). The data were statistically analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) as a first order construct. Results indicate that the perceived social rewards lead to an affective and normative commitment as well as consumers’ satisfaction, while the economic reward did not have an effect on developing affective bonds with members for long-term relationships. The relational benefit offered through the FFP creates affectively and normatively committed members who produce relational behaviors, in terms of WOM, immunity, openness and acquiescence of the members to the airline. Furthermore, the FFP members produced social behaviors toward the airline when they felt satisfied with their relational exchanges.",The Role of Relational Reward Benefits  for Developing the Non-Financial Value of a Customer to an Organization: Structural Equation Modeling Approach,2014-10-30,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the role of relational reward benefits for developing the nonfinancial value of a customer to an organization structural equation modeling approach research on the customer value to an organization has been widely explored yet most studies only determined on the financial value based on the customers purchasing behavior the value of customers beyond their purchasing behavior defined as the relational value has not been commonly captured yet this nonfinancial value is one of the drivers in retaining customers hence it becomes a crucial factor in preserving the profitability of the organization for this reason this paper aims to examine the customer nonfinancial valuations of a loyalty reward program the scope of the study covered a reward program involving consumer exertions in the context of a frequent flyer program ffp offered by an airline in indonesia the hypotheses were empirically tested with a sample of ffp members conducted through an online survey n the data were statistically analyzed using structural equation modeling sem as a first order construct results indicate that the perceived social rewards lead to an affective and normative commitment as well as consumer satisfaction while the economic reward did not have an effect on developing affective bonds with members for long-term relationships the relational benefits offered through the ffp creates affectively and normatively committed members who produce relational behaviors in terms of women's immunity openness and acquiescence of the members to the airline furthermore the ffp members produced social behaviors toward the airline when they felt satisfied with their relational exchanges,23387238,9

9,"The debate over which size industry is best suited for Indonesiacontinues with proponents of both large and small sizes pointing out the benefits of each. However, little empirical analysis has been done regarding economic matters such as technical efficiency. Nonparametric analysis of technical efficiency for three sizes of firms in seven manufacturing sectors is estimated using linear programming techniques. Aggregated input and output data from BPS from 1991 to 1997 are used.Household size firms are found to be most efficient relative to the other sizes for five of the seven sectors analyzed. Large firms are relatively more efficient in ‘Food, Beverage, and Tobacco’ sector. Small companies are relatively less efficient than household firms in all but one case, but relatively more efficient than large firms in five of seven sectors. The results validate and perhaps explain the duel economy in Indonesia with both large and small firms existing in the same industry.When each sector is analyzed for each firm size, the ‘Non-MetallicMineral Products Other Than Petroleum and Coal’ sector is most efficient for all sizes of firms. The least efficient sector is the ‘Chemical and Plastics’ industry.The results suggest that government policy should be focused oncreating a stable environment for business, which promotes growth of efficient businesses, either large or small.

9,"This study explores the relationship between real stock returns and inflationary trends in the Malaysian economy. It attempts to test for the relationship between real stock return and inflation in light of Fisher hypothesis that asserts the independence of real stock return and inflation and Fama’s (1981) proxy effect framework which states that the negative real stock returns-inflation is indirectly explained by a negative real economic activity-inflation and a positive real stock returns-real economicactivity relationships. The finding shows that real stock returns are independent of inflationary trends in accordance with the Fisher hypothesis, which implies that the Malaysian stock market provides a good hedge against inflation. The Fama’s proxy hypothesis is then tested to check for the consistency of the relationships. The positive relationship between inflation and real economic activity and the positive relationship betweenreal stock returns and real economic activity that totally contradicts the Fama’s proxy hypothesis however are found, to some extent, be consistent with the explanation of conventional macroeconomic theories of the Philip’s curve.","REAL STOCK RETURNS, INFLATIONARY TRENDS AND REAL ACTIVITY:  Evidence from Malaysia",2013-12-10,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,real stock returns inflationary trends and real activity evidence from Malaysia this study explores the relationship between real stock returns and inflationary trends in the Malaysian economy.

9,"Scholes and Wolfson (1992) predict that following the 1986 TaxReform Act, the tax cost of the corporate form relative to that of the partnership form (the incremental tax cost) increased significantly. This study hypothesizes that since dividends represent a tax disadvantaged form of income relative to capital gains, then in response to an increase in incremental tax costs, corporations would decrease their dividend payout ratios. The response is expected to be stronger for corporations owned byshareholders with long investment horizons because the tax cost saved from decreasing dividend payout ratios is an increasing function of shareholders’ investment horizon.

The population of the research, however, perceived that such wishes and expectations did not match with the reality. It is assumed that there had been mismanagement of the funds. The study is aimed at reviewing special autonomy financial performance and its management accountability. The study is performed through a qualitative approach with a phenomenological strategy— a study which is conducted at particular setting in a real live (natural setting) to investigate and understand phenomena. The data were collected from government employee, NGO officers, the target population, and other resources by observation, in-depth interviews, and library reviews. The results show that local government officials lack of capacity in handling the funds and there had been poor budget management as indicated from four management functions —planning, executing, reporting, and monitoring of educational funds— which were not implemented appropriately. A concept as a set of law and regulation that shapes Special Autonomy fund management of Papua Province is needed. Therefore, an integrated mechanism of building compliance and control system of educational funds management is necessary to reach the Value for Money (effectiveness, efficiency, and economics) of education budget.

9,"This study explains the dividend puzzle using the agency-cost frame work suggested by Easterbrook (1984). Easterbrook hypothesized that shareholders in firms, who increase cash dividend payout and ‘simultaneously' raise debts to finance their investments are likely to be wealthier than those in firms who only increase their cash dividend payout. He provided the mechanism that shareholders use the dividend payments to force managers to go to the capital markets to raise funds. Therefore, he argued that dividend policy influences the financing policy. A system of simultaneous equation using three-stage generalized least square method is used to test the hypotheses. Among the variables to proxy the investment opportunity set, market-to-book ratio, market-to-book assets ratio and accounting earnings-per-share-to-price ratio are the best proxies. Attempt is made to obtain better proxies for the investment opportunity set using an instrument variable method. The system is robust to alternate investment opportunity variables as well as to the instrumental variables. The findings are as follows.

9,"This paper reviews and summarizes previous works and the rationale for the proposition that accounting information is in fact value relevant in the determination of an initial public offering IPO).Theoretical and empirical evidence has indicated that certain accounting measures can he used as proxies for total firm risk, that is, they could determine the riskiness of a corporation. The literature also advocates that accounting information is relevant in determining the value and thus the riskiness of a corporation through the use of accounting analysis. Since most of the information available in the prospectus is accounting information, it is arguable that this information represents a potential source for assessing the issuing firm. Some scholars have also advocated the possibility of using accounting information in assessing the value of firm making an IPO. Numerous papers have provided analytical and empirical evidence of the association between accounting numbers and the value of IPOs. The conclusion generally comes to show that information in the prospectus is value relevant concerning the IPO.

9,"This paper attempts to examine which theory is best in explaining the geographic concentration in Java, an island in which most of the Indonesia’s large and medium manufacturing industries have located overwhelmingly. Using the regional specialization index as a measure of geographic concentration of manufacturing industry and pooling data over the period 1991-J996, our econometric analysis integrates the perspectives of industry, region (space), and time. The most striking result is that most of the NCT (Neo-Classical Theory) hypotheses can be rejected. Moreover, most of the findings support the NTT (New Trade Theory) and NEG (New Economic Geography). Our findings suggest that manufacturing firms in Java seek to locate in more populous and densely populated areas to enjoy both localization economies and urbanization economies, as shown by the significance of scale economies and income per capita. The interplay of agglomeration economies is intensified by the imperfect competition of Java's market structure. This paper gives empirical evidence with respect to path dependency hypotheses. This finding supports the NEG's belief that history matters: older firms tend to enhance regional specialization.

9,"Irrespective of the success of the Indonesian Government to achieve self-sufficiency of rice in 1985, and the rice price stabilization, paddy growers still suffer from a very low price for their produce. Koperasi Unit Desa (KUDs) –in Indonesian, or Village Unit Cooperative (VUC) have been entrusted with the marketing of rice paddies although their performance has always been less than satisfactory. One problem experienced by the KUDs is not having sufficient cash to purchase and process paddies into rice. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a simulation model to represent cash flows during one paddy plantation season for a KUD (VUC). The simulation model is a decision support tool that enables a KUD’s (VUC) management to determine the maximum quantity of paddies to be purchased; the minimum borrowing and additional borrowing; and the earnings before taxes. An investigator- administrated questionnaire was used to collect historical data of the twenty randomly selected KUDs (VUC) on Lombok Island to validate the sub-models of the simulation model. The Kolmogorov- Smirnov Goodness of Fit (two-sample), linear regression, correlation and t- tests were used to validate the simulation model. The validation results have shown that the sub-models of the simulation model are valid, and these may contribute to the valid results of the simulation model. This study has found that the limitations of the paddy storage building, drying floor, and milling machine owned by the KUDs (VUC) may restrict the KUDs (VUC) from buying the entire paddies harvested. Therefore, further research is needed to find out the minimum capacities of those facilities enabling the KUDs (VUC) to work efficiently.Keywords: agricultural cooperatives (Village Unit Cooperative); seasonal demands; cash flows; simulation; validation",Developing a Seasonal Cash Demand Simulation for Agricultural Cooperatives (Village Unit Cooperative) in Indonesia,2012-01-01,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,developing a seasonal cash demand simulation for agricultural cooperatives village unit cooperative in Indonesia irrespective of the success of the Indonesian government to achieve self-sufficiency of rice in and the rice price stabilization paddy growers still suffer from a very low price for their produce kuds village unit cooperatives in Indonesian or village unit cooperative vuc has been entrusted with the marketing of rice paddies although their performance has always been less than satisfactory one problem experienced by the kuds is not having sufficient cash to purchase and process paddies into rice the The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a simulation model to represent cash flows during one paddy plantation season for a kud vuc the simulation model is a decision support tool that enables a kuds vuc management to determine the maximum quantity of paddies to be purchased the minimum borrowing and additional borrowing and the earnings before taxes an investigator administrated questionnaire was used to collect historical data of the twenty randomly selected kuds vuc on lombok island to validate the submodels of the simulation model the kolmogorov smirnov goodness of fit twosample linear regression correlation and t tests were used to validate the simulation model the validation results have shown that the submodels of the simulation model are valid and these may contribute to the valid results of the simulation model this study has found that the limitations of the paddy storage building drying floor and milling machine owned by the kuds vuc may restrict the kuds vuc from purchasing the entire paddies harvested therefore further research is needed to find out the minimum capacities of those facilities enabling the kuds vuc to work efficiently keywords agricultural cooperatives village unit cooperative seasonal demands cash flows simulation validation,23387238,9
9,"Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have a critical role in economic growth in Indonesia and become the backbone for job creation, poverty alleviation, and safeguard during the crisis. However, they are highly exposed to uncertain environments. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of SMEs’ entrepreneurial orientation on business performance when uncertain environments exist. A total of 152 Indonesian SMEs were studied in order to assess this relationship. Moderated regression analysis is performed as the main statistical procedures to analyse the moderating role of environmental uncertainty on the influence of entrepreneurial orientation on business performance. Surprisingly, the result of the present study did not confirm the previous predominant studies which found that entrepreneurialorientation dimensions are positively associated with business performance in growing in an uncertain environment.

9,"This study aims to examine the relationship between knowledge stickiness and a firm’s innovation capability in the context of developing countries, i.e., Indonesia. The main research question addressed by this study is: does knowledge stickiness affect a firm’s innovation capability? Using data from 100 small- and medium-sized furniture enterprises (SMEs), the study finds that product innovations are predominant over process and organizational ones. However, incremental innovations are often more preferred than radical ones. This study also finds that the firms absorb knowledge from various sources to undertake innovations. Buyers, Internet, and suppliers are the significant sources, for sensory, coded, and theoretical knowledge. Buyers are also the main source of a great extent of various knowledge domains related to product, process, and organizational innovations. In general, the furniture firms do not pay considerable attention to planning stages when introducing innovations, as indicated by the fact that not all innovations are preceded by initiatives, except for really new processes and organizational innovations whose impact on the firms’ revenue is less visible. Out of four dimensions of knowledge stickiness used in this study, three of them (i.e., knowledge interconnectedness, sensory knowledge, and coded knowledge) are proven to have significant impact on a firm’s innovation capability. We find, knowledge interconnectedness and coded knowledge have a positive impact, while sensory knowledge influences a firm’s innovation capability in a negative direction. All in all, this study provides empirical evidence that knowledge stickiness has a significant impact on a firm’s innovation capability (explains 36% of total variance).",Does Knowledge Stickiness Affect a Firm’s Innovation Capability?

9,"The purpose of this study is to investigate whether abnormal accrual mispricing acknowledged in accounting literature is a manifestation of documented value-glamour anomaly in finance literature. This study proposes the traditional value-glamour proxies (sales growth, book-to-market, earningprice, cash flows-price, and size) and CFO/P ratio (ratio of operating cash flows and stock price) to explain the mispricing of abnormal accruals. Using a sample of 540 firm-year observations of companies listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSE) from the period of 1993 to 2003, the study finds that individually, only either the E/P or CFO/P ratio can pick up the mispricing attributed to abnormal accruals. These results can be interpreted as follows: (1) as captured by E/P ratio, abnormal accrual mispricing is due to the market’s inability to understand managers’ attempts to manage reported earnings; (2) as captured by the CFO/P, the market is unable to assess the persistence of cash flows. From a practical standpoint, this study has simplified the research agenda related to asset pricing. The result suggests that a researcher can control for the abnormal accrual mispricing and the value-glamour anomaly parsimoniously via just one variable, E/P ratio.Keywords: business performance; entrepreneurial orientation; environmental uncertainty",The Link of Abnormal Accrual Mispricing and Value- Glamour Stock Anomaly: Evidence from the Indonesian Capital Market,2012-01-01,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the link of abnormal accrual mispricing and value glamor stock anomaly evidence from the Indonesian capital market the purpose of this study is to investigate whether abnormal accrual mispricing acknowledged in accounting literature is a manifestation of documented value glamor anomaly in finance literature this study proposes the traditional value glamor proxies sales growth booktomarket earningsprice cash flowsprice and size and cfop ratio ratio of operating cash flows and stock price to explain the mispricing of abnormal accruals using a sample of firmyear observations of companies listed on the jakarta stock exchange jse from the period of to the study finds that individually only either the ep or cfop ratio can pick up the mispricing attributed to abnormal accruals these results can be interpreted as follows as captured by abnormal ep ratio accrual mispricing is due to the markets inability to understand managers attempts to manage reported earnings as captured by the cfop the market is unable to assess the persistence of cash flows from a practical standpoint this study has simplified the research agenda related to asset pricing the results suggest that a researcher can control for the abnormal accrual mispricing and the value glamor anomaly parsimoniously via just one variable ep ratio keywords business performance entrepreneurial orientation environmental uncertainty,23387238,9
9,"This paper is an extended version of our earlier study (Abd.

To measure their efficiencies, the output-input data consisting of a panel of conventional and Islamic mutual funds companies are empirically examined based on the most commonly used non-parametric approach, namely, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It also attempts to investigate the influence of the mutual funds companies’ characteristicson efficiency measures using the Generalized Least Square (GLS) estimation. The study finds that, on average, the Indonesian mutual funds companies experienced a decrease in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth. It is mainly caused by a decline in both efficiency and technical efficiencies, where the efficiency change is largely contributed by the changes in pure efficiency rather than scale efficiency. Additionally, the study also documents that the funds size negatively affects efficiency. This indicates that due to its diseconomies of scale, a larger mutual funds company is less efficient than a smaller funds company.

9,"Social entrepreneurs are viewed as having the abilities to combat social and economic problems in which government, businesses, and non-profits may not be able to solve the problems alone. Consequently, with the collaboration among these sectors, more social enterprises can be established to create social values and development in a nation, specifically among the emerging economies. Therefore, it is timely to investigate what motivates undergraduates to develop social entrepreneurial intention. Drawing from the entrepreneurial models of Shapero and Sokol (1982) and Kruger and Brazeal (1994), this study aims to examine the social entrepreneurial intention among undergraduates from the perspective of an emerging economy. The proposed conceptual model differs from the existing entrepreneurial intention studies by adding the concepts of empathy and social entrepreneurship exposure as the antecedents to perceived desirability and perceived feasibility of social enterprising start-up, which in turn link to social entrepreneurial intention. Using the quota sampling technique, data were collected from 257 business and economics undergraduates from both public and private higher education institutions in Malaysia. The survey instrument was adapted from prior related studies, for instance, Davis (1983) for empathy; Shapero and Sokol (1982) for social entrepreneurship exposure; Krueger (1993) for perceived desirability and perceived feasibility; and Chen et al. (1998) for social entrepreneurial intention. Partial least squares path modelling was used to analyze the hypothesized relationships in the proposed conceptual framework.

9,"Creative industries tend to cluster in specific places and the reasons for this phenomenon can be a multiplicity of elements linked mainly to culture, creativity, innovation and local development. In the international literature, it is pretty well recognized that creativity is frequently characterized by the agglomeration of firms so that creative industries are not homogeneously distributed across the territory but they are concentrated in the space. Three theories are becoming the dominant theoretical perspectives in agglomeration economies theory and they are increasingly being applied in industrial clusters analysis to study the effect of clustering industries. The theories are Marshall’s theoretical principles of localization economies, Schmitz’s collective efficiency and Porter’s five-diamond approach. However, those have adequately theorized neither the institutionalization process through which change takes place nor the socio-economic context of the institutional formations of clustering creative industries. This text begins by reviewing three main theories to more fully articulate institutionalization processes of an economic institution. Specifically, this paper incorporates new institutional economics (NIE) and new economic sociology (NES) to explain the processes associated with creating institutional practices within clustering creative industries. Both streams of institutional theory constitute that economic organizations are socially constructed. Next, this text proposes the framework that depicts the socio-economic context better and more directly addresses the dynamics of enacting, embedding and changing organizational features and processes within clustering creative industries. Some pertinent definitions are offered to be used in a conceptual framework of research about how economic institutions like clustering creative industries constitute their structures.",What Factors Constitute Structures of Clustering Creative Industries?

9,"This paper examines whether the degree of matching for poor-performing fraud firms varies depending on the strength of the causal relation between expenses and revenues. A stronger causal relation exists between revenues and operating expenses than between revenues and total expenses that include non-operating expenses as well as operating expenses. Fraud firms have stronger incentives for managing earnings. Given that managing earnings is easier when using non-operating items than when using operating items, the degree of matching is (not) lower for fraud firms than for non-fraud firms at the strong (weak) level of the causal relation between revenues and expenses. Empirical results suggest that the degrees of matching are different between fraud and non-fraud firms only at the strong level of the causal relation between revenues and expenses. This result implies that the investigation of the matching model at a strong level of the causal relation between revenues and expenses is more effective than that at a weak level of the causal relation, with regard to examining the degree of matching for fraud firms.

9,"This research empirically and comparatively examines the quality of conventional and Islamic banks’ asset management in Indonesia during the period 2009-2011. Four general conventional banks [i.e., Bank Mandiri Indonesia (BMI), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Bank Central Asia (BCA), and Bank Nasional Indonesia (BNI)] and four Islamic banks (Bank Muamalat, Bank Syariah Mandiri, Bank Syariah Mega Indonesia, and Bank Syariah BRI) were, respectively, explored. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to compare the quality of the Islamic and conventional banks’ asset management with the CAMEL (capital, asset, management, earning, and liquidity) method. It also attempts to analyse the influences of the ROA (Return on Asset), TLTA (Total Loan to Total Assets), and OITL (Operating Income to Total Liabilities) on the quality of the banks’ asset management. The CAMEL method was used to evaluate the quality level of the banks’ asset management, while the multiple regression analysis was then adopted to explore the determinants of the quality of the banks’ asset management. The study documented that Bank Syariah BRI was the best performing bank, with the highest CAMEL score of 50.33, while Bank Mandiri Indonesia was the worst performer with the lowest CAMEL score of 26.33. As a group, the Islamic banks were found to have better rankings, i.e., positions 1, 2, 3, and 6, while the conventional banks were found in 4, 5, 7, and 8, respectively.

9,"The informal sector in Indonesia is massive, and has become a challenge to the growth of the open market economy. Explanations of the cause of informality have shifted over time from structural dualism to excessive government regulation. This paper argues that merely focusing on the high cost regulation may not reveal the bottom line of informality. Assessment and elaboration of infomality need the help of the transaction cost approach that suggests that informality in the economy exists due to the high-transaction-cost institutional framework. To support the argument, this paper provides a preliminary study on the transaction costs borne by firms in the industrial manufacturing sector based on two industrial surveys conducted by BPS-Statistics Indonesia, which are the 2009 survey on medium and large-scale enterprises (MLEs) and the 2010 survey on micro and small-scale enterprises (MSEs). This paper shows that micro and small-scale enterprises with no legality bore the least transaction costs compared to those operating legally, both micro and small-scale, as well as medium and large-scale enterprises. Consequently, regulatory reforms aimed at reducing transaction costs, not merely aimed at reducing official costs and simplifying procedures, are the keys to achieving economic growth while ensuring full participation of the private sector.",Explaining the Informal Sector in Indonesia from the Transaction Costs Perspective,2014-02-28,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,explaining the informal sector in Indonesia from the transaction costs perspective the informal sector in Indonesia is massive and has become a challenge to the growth of the open market economy explanations of the causes of informality have shifted over time from structural dualism to excessive government regulation this paper argues that solely focusing on the high cost regulation may not reveal the bottom line of informality assessment and elaboration of informality need the help of the transaction cost approach that suggests that informality in the economy exists due to the high transaction cost institutional framework to support the argument of this paper provides a preliminary study on the transaction costs borne by firms in the industrial manufacturing sector based on two industrial surveys conducted by bpsstatistics indonesia which are the survey on medium and largescale enterprises mles and the survey on micro and smallscale enterprises mses this paper shows that micro and smallscale with no legality bore the least transaction costs compared to those operating legally both micro and small scale as well as medium and large scale enterprises accordingly regulatory reforms aimed at reducing transaction costs not merely aimed at reducing official costs and simplifying procedures are the keys to achieving economic growth while ensuring full participation of the private sector,23387238,9

The Indonesian government has initiated and implemented a series of plans and activities to promote technology use to increase SMEs’ performance. Despite such efforts, technology adoption rate are still low. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors affecting an entrepreneurs’ decision on internet adoption, by measuring technology readiness (TR). The purpose of this study is to investigate TR and the extent to which E-commerce is adopted amongst entrepreneurs. This study is replication of Parasuraman’s study on the Technology Readiness Index (TRI). Questionnaires were distributed using a convenience sampling method to 190 entrepreneurs of SME in Bandung city. The findings indicate that entrepreneurs are moderate in terms of their TR. There are significant differences in terms of TR across entrepreneurs’ backgrounds (gender, age, education, and income). In relation to internet adoption by those surveyed, as their use of media promotion is still low, there were only 36.3 percent who adopted it. The results clearly indicate the need to provide support to SMEs to adopt and use e-commerce. These results have implications not only for managers of SMEs but also for government agencies in developing countries such as Indonesia.

9,"This study examines the role of banking development quality in the FDI-growth nexus from 1998 to 2009. Banking development quality is measured using two standardized intermediation  cost indicators and an index of banking development quality that is constructed based on the following indicators: overhead costs to total assets and net interest margin. The results for developed countries show that, on its own, FDI is negatively related to economic growth. However, when FDI is interacted with a banking development quality index, the quality of banking development is found to play a positive role in influencing the effects of FDI on economic growth. This suggests that the quality of banking development serves as an absorptive capacity that allows developed countries to benefit from the positive growth effects of FDI. On the contrary, for emerging countries, the findings indicate that banking development quality plays no role in influencing the impact of FDI on economic growth. This implies that the quality of banking development in emerging countries has yet to reach a level that allows it to importantly influence the growth effects of FDI.",FDI and Economic Growth —  Does the Quality of Banking Development Matter?,2014-09-29,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,fdi and economic growth does the quality of banking development matter this study examines the role of banking development quality in the fdigrowth nexus from to banking development quality is measured using two standardized intermediation cost indicators and an index of banking development quality that is constructed based on the following indicators overhead costs to total assets and net interest margin the results for developed countries show that on its own fdi is negatively related to economic growth however when fdi is interacted with a banking development quality index the quality of banking development is found to play a positive role in influencing the effects of fdi on economic growth this suggests that the quality of banking development serves as an absorptive capacity that allows developing countries to benefit from the positive growth effects of fdi on the contrary for emerging countries the findings indicate that banking development quality plays no role in influencing the impact of fdi on economic growth this implies that the quality of banking development in emerging countries has yet to reach a level that allows it to significantly influence the growth effects of fdi,23387238,9

9,"The purpose of this study is to develop a new integrative theory of motivation drawn from the existing theories and data. The method used is a combination of meta-ethnography and grounded theory. The second phase of the study employed a thought experiment to test the newly developed theoretical propositions of motivational force. The first phase of the study revealed a central phenomenon for the occurrence of motivational force, i.e. “In Search for Anchors,” which is a result of the paradox between freedom to choose and human vulnerability. “Freedom to choose” is the central factor of a motivational model that includes “urge,” “challenge,” “incentive,” and “meaning.” These five factors are motivational sources, which have holistic-dynamic-integrative interaction. Human vulnerability is the other side of the motivational model that comprises risk, uncertainty, and hope that ignite motivational force. The dynamic interaction of risk, uncertainty, and hope is represented in a mathematical formula that produces the strength of the force, (R – H)2 x U, which can be potrayed in a “twin-peak” curve. The thought experiment was conducted to test the hypothetical formula. The result shows that the “twin-peak” hypothesis is supported but the shape of the curve is found to be not symmetrical.

9,"Using minimum spanning tree technique (MST), this exploratory research was done to optimize the interrelation and hierarchical network design of Indonesian’s airports. This research also identifies the position of the Indonesian’s airports regionally based on the ASEAN Open Sky Policy 2015. The secondary data containing distance between airports (both in Indonesia and in ASEAN), flight frequency, and correlation of Gross Domestic Regional Product (GDRP) for each region in Indonesia are used as inputs to form MST networks. The result analysis is done by comparing the MST networks with the existing network in Indonesia. This research found that the existing airport network in Indonesia does not depict the optimal network connecting all airports with the shortest distance and maximizing the correlation of regional economic potential in the country. This research then suggests the optimal networks and identifies the airports and regions as hubs and spokes formed by the networks.

9,"Reduced auditor independence and the rise of corporate accounting manipulations have caused trust of the users in audited financial statements to begin to decline, so users of financial statements are questioning whether public accountants are independent parties. This research issue is related to the Decree of the Minister of Finance No. 17 in 2008 about public accountant services. Giving attestation services, in the form of financial statements about an entity, are conducted by the audit firm for no longer than 6 consecutive fiscal years and by a public accountant for 3 consecutive fiscal years at the longest. The purpose of this research is to examine empirically the influence of auditor tenure on audit quality. Auditor tenure is measured as the length of the auditor-client relationship. Audit quality is measured by the propensity of auditors to issue a going-concern opinion. This study uses a sample of firms listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the 2003-2008 period. Research analysis uses logit model to measure the effect of auditor tenure on the auditors’ propensity to publish a going-concern opinion. The hypothesis which states that the length of auditor tenure influences negatively the propensity of auditors to issue a going-concern opinion is statistically supported.

9,"This study empirically examines the behaviour of Indonesian stock market under the efficient market hypothesis framework by emphasizing on the random walk behaviour and nonlinearity over the period of April 1983 - December 2010. In the first step, the standard linear unit root test, namely the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Phillip-Perron (PP) test and Kwiatkowski-Philllips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test identify the random walk behaviour in the indices. In order to take account the possible breaks in the index series Zivot and Adrews (1992) one break and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) two breaks unit root test are employed to observe whether the presence of breaks in the data series will prevent the stocks from randomly pricing or vice versa. In the third step, we employ Harvey et al. (2008) test to examine the presence of nonlinear behaviour in Indonesian stock indices. The evidence of nonlinear behaviour in the indices, motivate us to use nonlinear unit root test procedure recently developed by Kapetanios et al. (2003) and Kruse (2010).

Contradictory results were found when comparing firms with perfect fit with those that have strategy misfit. Further analyses indicate that all those strategy misfit firms operate in high entry barriers, where firms can compete effectively using either innovation or cost efficiency strategy due to the fact that they possess resources that are difficult to be imitated by their competitors.","Investigating the Joint Effects of Strategy,  Environment and Control Structure on Performance",2011-09-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,investigating the joint effects of strategy environment and control structure on performance the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of misfit between competitive environment business strategy and control structure on performance we argue that the misfit between competitive environment business strategy and control structure has been significantly negative implications on shareholder value creation associated with firms joint venture formation based on data of publicly traded us manufacturing firms that announced a joint venture formation we found that firms that have perfect fit are valued higher than those with both strategy and structural misfits and also those with structural misfit contradictory results were found when comparing firms with perfect fit with those that have strategy misfit further analyzes indicate that all those strategy misfit firms operate in high entry barriers where firms can compete effectively using either innovation or cost efficiency strategy due to the fact that they possess resources that are difficult to be imitated by their competitors,23387238,9

9,"Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) internationalization intelligence, referring to the process of gathering information and knowledge on international opportunities, is crucial to initiate SMEs’ internationalization. The literature has stressed organizational resources, networks and information sharing as means to acquire internationalization intelligence, suggesting that the resource-based, network and social capital perspectives can be adopted to explore this issue. However, previous literature still lacks evidence on how SMEs acquire relevant intelligence, and who or what are involved with the process. To address this lack of evidence, we interviewed 54 SME owners/key personnel in the manufacturing sector to: identify sources of internationalization intelligence; examine how those sources assist SMEs to internationalize; and develop propositions on internationalization intelligence. Analyzing the data using NVivo, four themes emerged including institutions, business associates, personal efforts, and other means. The analysis suggests internationalization intelligence occurs mainly through the networks of the SME owners/key personnel, built on their firm’s resources through their internal and external information sharing activities, indicating the need of the SMEs to position themselves in their environments.

The current study additionally examines the relationships between QMPs and CFP through WCC, OE, and CNFP (as partial mediators) simultaneously. The study uses data from a survey of 140 strategic business units (SBUs) within 49 oil and gas contractor companies in Indonesia.  The findings suggest that all six QMPs have positive and significant indirect relationships on CFP through WCC and CNFP. Only four of six QMPs have positive and significant indirect relationships on CFP through OE and CNFP. Hence, WCC, OE, and CNFP play as partial mediators between  QMPs and CFP. CNFP has a significant influence on CFP. A major implication of this study is that oil and gas managers need to recognize the structural relations model fit by developing all of the research constructs simultaneously associated with a comprehensive TQM practice. Furthermore, the findings will assist oil and gas companies by improving CNFP, which is very critical to TQM, thereby contributing to a better achievement of CFP.

The emergence of BreadTalk in Indonesia in the bakery industry with a different concept bakery store has caused rapid development in this industry. One strategy used by BreadTalk to encourage consumers to visit, feel the different experience, and ultimately to increase consumer purchase intention is to use dimensional olfactory as one of the elements in the store ambience. With this phenomenon, this study aims to find the significant influence of the olfactory, approach behavior, experiential marketing toward purchase intention. Collecting data in this study was done by spreading questionnaires to students of the University of Pelita Harapan, who had visited and shopped at BreadTalk Supermal Karawaci. The questionnaires were distributed to 150 respondents. The variables that exist in the study are measured using the Likert scale. The sample collection technique used was a non-probability sampling technique of sampling with a purposive sampling method. The data are then processed by using reliability analysis, validity, and methods of structural equation modelling analysis. From the results of this study the significant influence from olfactory to 3 variables mentioned above can be seen.","Analysis of the Effect of Olfactory, Approach Behavior, and Experiential Marketing toward Purchase Intention",2011-02-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,analysis of the effect of olfactory approach behavior and experiential marketing toward purchase intention the drive of retail business competition is getting tighter and causing retailers to seek to attract consumers to be regular and loyal at their stores retailers need to understand consumer behavior in order to obtain what is desired by consumers therefore consumer behavior needs to be studied considering various factors which can influence consumer decisions to buy a product the emergence of bread talk in Indonesia in the bakery industry with a different concept bakery store has caused rapid development in this industry one strategy used by breadtalk to encourage consumers to visit feel the different experience and ultimately to increase consumer purchase intention is to use olfactory dimensions as one of the elements in the store ambience with this phenomenon this study aims to find the significant influence of the olfactory approach behavior experiential marketing toward purchase intention collecting data in this study was carried out by spreading questionnaires to students of the university of pelita Harapan who had visited and shopped at breadtalk supermal karawaci the questionnaires were distributed to respondents the variables that existed in the study were measured using the likert scale the sample collection technique used was a nonprobability sampling technique of sampling with a purposive sampling method the data are then processed by using reliability analysis validity and methods of structural equation modeling analysis from the results of this study the significant influence from olfactory to variables mentioned above can be seen,23387238,9

9,"This paper provides survey evidence on the use of derivatives among firms listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The finding shows that the participation rate in the use of derivatives is 28.8 percent, much lower than those found in developed countries. For the derivatives non-users, insignificant risk exposure is reported as the most important rationale for not using derivatives. Consumer goods industry constitutes the largest proportion of firms using derivatives. The majority of respondents utilize derivatives to hedge against financial risks rather than to speculate. Foreign currency risk and interest rate risk are the most important types of risks faced with by respondents. Using the Chi-square and the Fisher’s exact tests, the result corroborates the size effect hypothesis, where the use of derivatives is more popular among large firms than small firms.

9,"According to the UN, air pollution kills more than 3 millionpeople each year (UN-Habitat 2007). Despite the magnitude ofthe impact, delays in making decisions about the environmentare quite common among governments worldwide. The purposesof this study are twofold. First, the study is to investigate therelative strength of attributes of environmental policy such asmethods of vehicle restriction, percentage of reduction in lead (and CO2) content, and percentage of subsidy reduction. Second, the study is to test government choice when it facesconservative, “scientific,” and popular policy alternatives. Toachieve both objectives this research uses an experimentalmethod. The orthogonal design is adopted for stimuli presenta-tion and conjoint analysis is used for data analysis. The re-search participants are students of an accounting graduateprogram of a state university in Java (Indonesia).The results suggest CO2/lead reduction has the strongesteffect on policy maker preference.

The findings of this study show that several new trends in social, environmental and sustainability assurance can be observed. Firstly, accountants tend to limit their intended readership to management only and state a disclaimer for other potential readers. This diminishes the transparency and stakeholder accountability of the reporting. Secondly, there is even stronger evidence that management has the control over the scope of the assurance engagement and over what information gets publicly disclosed. The evidence is shown in the fact that in many assurance statements prepared by accountants, only selected parts of the reports are being assured, with no indication that it is not management who selects these parts.

9,"A series of relatively high inflation characterize Indonesian economy, especially during the economic crisis. Economists generally agree that high inflation is one of the major economic problems, and that economic authorities need to cope with such a problem. Therefore, it is essential to understand the behavior of inflation in Indonesia. The aim of this paper is to estimate the inflation dynamics in Indonesia using equilibrium correction and forward-looking Phillips Curve approaches. Previous empirical studies show that the equilibrium correction or backward-looking approach may explain the inflation dynamics in Indonesia. The backward-looking specification does not have to be the proper model even if the fact shows that the specification holds. The major innovation of this paper is the application of a forward-looking Phillips curve model. The empirical results—estimated using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)—show that the forward-looking Phillips Curve approach dominates the backward-looking behavior. It indicates that after a credible monetary policy announcement, for instance, the former model predicts that economic agents will change their behavior quickly.

9,"The purpose of this study is to examine the perceived importance and usefulness of corporate annual reports in Malaysia and to determine if there is a difference between the perceptions of preparers and users of corporate annual reports. Data for this study were collected using a questionnaire survey conducted in late 2006 and early 2007. Preparers are represented by chief financial officers while users by investment analysts. The mean scores for preparers and users are compared using the independent samples t test and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to determine if there are any statistically significant differences in their opinions. The findings reveal that preparers rank the annual report as the most important source of corporate information.

9,"This study aims to investigate whether: (1) the change in debt level is affected by agency problems, the probability of bankruptcy, firm size, and profitability; (2) the change in debt level is affected by multinationality (i.e., multinational corporations (MNCs) or domestic corporations (DCs)) and whether multinationality affects the relationship of agency problems, probability of bankruptcy, size, and profitability to the change in debt level. This study finds that in general, the change in debt level is negatively affected by the probability of bankruptcy and size. Furthermore, the changes in debt level for Indonesian MNCs are negatively affected by the probability of bankruptcy, firm size, and profitability. The negative effects of size and profitability on the change in debt level support the view of the Pecking Order Theory. However, for domestic companies, none of the determinants has a significant effect on the change in debt level. We also find that: (1) only size has a negative influence on the change in debt level when we include all interactive terms in the model; (2) if we include one interactive variable at a time, the probability of bankruptcy, firm size, and profitability have negative influences on the change in debt level; in addition, a positive impact of agency problems on the change in debt level is more pronounced for MNCs compared to DCs. Overall, we conclude that multinationality affects the relationship between agency problems and the change in debt level.Keywords: capital structure; Indonesia leverage; multinational corporations",The Influence of Multinationality on Determinants of Change in Debt Level: Empirical Evidence from Indonesia,2010-01-15,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the influence of multinationality on determinants of change in debt level empirical evidence from Indonesia this study aims to investigate whether the change in debt level is affected by agency problems the probability of bankruptcy firm size and profitability the change in debt level is affected by multinationality i e multinational corporations mncs or domestic corporations dcs and whether multinationality affects the relationship of agency problems probability of bankruptcy size and profitability to the change in debt level this study finds that in general the change in debt level is negatively affected by the probability of bankruptcy and size furthermore the changes in debt level for Indonesian MNCs are negatively affected by the probability of bankruptcy firm size and profitability the negative effects of size and profitability on the change in debt level support the view of the pecking order theory however for domestic companies none of the determinants has a significant effect on the change in debt level we also find that only size has a negative influence on the change in debt level when we include all interactive terms in the model if we include one interactive variable at a time the probability of bankruptcy firm size and profitability have negative influences on the change in debt level in addition to a positive impact of agency problems on the change in debt level is more pronounced for mncs compared to dcs overall we conclude that multinationality affects the relationship between agency problems and the change in debt level keywords capital structure indonesia leverage multinational corporations,23387238,9

We argue that a firm’s financial performance will be positively affected by its ability to satisfy its customers. By satisfying its customers, a firm increases its ability to acquire new customers, retain existing customers, and increase customer profitability.

9,"This paper analyzes whether the expansionary fiscal policy funded by issuing debt instruments in financial markets will increase short-term interest rates. If  the expansionary fiscal policy increases interest rates, which decrease private spending especially investment, crowding out occurs. This is interesting because global economic crisis has encouraged many countries to run large budget deficits to stimulate the economy. Indonesia has also run budget deficit during this crisis and even in years before. The impact of such a policy can be significant because Indonesia’s debt market is still narrow and shallow. Therefore, its capability of absorbing the government debt instruments without influencing the private sector funding is limited. This study tests whether the crowding out occurs in Indonesia using a time series econometric model inspired by Cebula and Cuellar’s model. The Cointegration Regression and Error Correction Model (ECM) are used in this study. Monthly data from April 2000 to December 2008 are used for overnight real interbank call money interest rates, real net government bond issues in trading, real narrow money supply, real rate of one-month Certificate of Bank Indonesia, growth of Gross Domestic Product, and real net international capital flows.

9,"In Indonesia, Law No. 40/2007 paragraph 74 on Limited Liability Corporation regulates corporate social responsibility (CSR). Although CSR is mandatory for Indonesian resource-based firms, only four months after its enactment, six parties have asked for a judicial review to the Constitution Court as to the mandatory implementation of CSR. They argue that the mandatory implementation of CSR might result in legal uncertainty, render businesses inefficient, decrease competitiveness, and trigger discriminative treatments. Using the cases of CSR after the earthquake in Yogyakarta, this paper aims at answering the question of whether the implementation of CSR will lead to a decrease in competitiveness. Harnessing a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative approaches, this paper examines the models of beliefs, attitudes, and purchase intentions of consumers toward a company implementing CSR. The first phase of this study used a focus group discussion (FGD) to collect data from those who had benefited from CSR, and was analyzed using the content analysis. The results of the first phase then became the basis for the second phase. In the second phase, data were collected by surveying parents of school children whose school buildings were reconstructed by CSR programs, and answers were analyzed using the partial least squares analysis. Results show that the conjecture that the implementation of CSR will result in a decrease in competitiveness is not true. It is evident that CSR program affects the attitudes of consumers toward the firm, and that attitude fully mediates the relation between beliefs and purchase intentions toward the products of the firm implementing CSR.","The Implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Central Java Earthquake: A Preliminary Study on Consumer Belief, Attitude, and Purchase Intention",2009-09-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the implementation of corporate social responsibility csr in central java earthquake a preliminary study on consumer belief attitude and purchase intention in indonesia law no paragraph on limited liability corporation regulates corporate social responsibility csr although csr is mandatory for indonesian resource-based firms only four months after its enactment six parties have asked for a judicial review to the constitution court as to the mandatory implementation of csr they argue that the mandatory implementation of csr might result in legal uncertainty rendering businesses inefficient decrease competitiveness and trigger discriminatory treatments using the cases of csr after the earthquake in yogyakarta this paper aims at answering the question of whether the implementation of csr will lead to a decrease in competitiveness harnessing a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative approaches this paper examines the models of beliefs attitudes and purchase intentions of consumers toward a company implementing csr the first phase of this study used a focus group discussion fgd to collect data from those who had benefited from csr and was analyzed using the content analysis the results of the first phase then became the basis for the second phase in the second phase data were collected by surveying parents of school children whose school buildings were reconstructed by csr programs and answers were analyzed using the partial least squares analysis results show that the conjecture that the implementation of csr will result in a decrease in competitiveness is not true it is evident that csr programs affect the attitudes of consumers toward the firm and that attitude fully mediates the relationship between beliefs and purchase intentions toward the products of the firm implementing CSR,23387238,9
9,"This paper discusses and proposes the policy issues associated with the development of microfinance industry in Indonesia. Despite its capability of financing small-scale businesses, the development of the microfinance industry is far behind that of commercial banks. The policy focus on developing sound financial practices of microbanks has ignored the role of semi-formal and informal microfinance institutions (MFIs) in serving poor people. Compliance with the sound banking practices could inevitably drive microbanks away from serving the poor. Regarding the capability of informal and semi-formal MFIs of outreaching the poor, the challenges to microfinance policy in Indonesia is to develop inclusive financial systems through which the progress of microbanks goes in a parallel direction with the developments of semi-formal and informal MFIs, such as cooperatives and rotating saving and credit associations (ROSCAs).",The Pro-poor Policy of Microfinance in Indonesia,2009-09-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the policy proposals of microfinance in Indonesia this paper discusses and proposes the policy issues associated with the development of microfinance industry in Indonesia despite its capability of financing smallscale businesses the development of the microfinance industry is far behind that of commercial banks the policy focus on developing sound financial practices of microbanks has ignored the role of semiformal and informal microfinance institutions mfis in serving poor people compliance with the sound banking practices could inevitably drive microbanks away from serving the poor regarding the capability of informal and semiformal mfis of outreaching the poor the challenges to microfinance policy in indonesia is to develop inclusive financial systems through which the progress of microbanks goes in a parallel direction with the developments of semiformal and informal mfis such as cooperatives and rotating savings and credit associations roscas,23387238,9

The framework suggests that collaborative practice is characterised by three distinct factors: (1) decision synchronisation, (2) information sharing, and (3) incentive alignment, which enable the chain members to effectively match supply with customer demand. An important question is whether or not collaborative practice leads to better operational performance. A survey research was employed to assess the relationship between collaborative practice and operational performance of New Zealand companies. The survey results show significant positive impacts of key factors of collaborative practice on operational performance.

Since the early 1980s, the Indonesian government has adopted SME development policy through a clustering approach. This paper reviews the existing empirical studies on development of SME clusters in Indonesia. This paper deals with two main questions. First, what are the critical success factors of development of an SME cluster. Second to what extent this policy has contributed to the dynamic of SME clusters in the country. The paper argues that in many cases, the development policy has not been so successful. In essence, most failures can be attributed to the fact that one or more critical factors for successful SME cluster development were either not existing or not addressed correctly. Neglecting cluster linkage to markets is one reason of the failure.

9,"This study tests the joint effects of dividend and earnings information. A study of joint effects is justified for the following reasons. First, dividends and earnings are considered two of the most important signaling devices (Aharony and Swary 1980) that investors use in evaluating stock prices. Second, dividends and earnings are 'garbled' information (Ohlson 1989). Dividends and earnings may contain corroborating or disconfirming news. Third, investors may be have with memory, revising beliefs in complex ways in evaluating a sequence of information. Prior dividend studies that controlling for earnings announcement effects do not address these possibilities. Using Hogarth and Einhorn's (1992) belief-adjustment theory, this study models the behavior of investor reactions to joint dividend and earnings surprises. The theory predicts that order and timing of dividend and earnings surprises have different effects on stock returns. When dividend and earnings surprises have opposite signs (mixedevidence), the theory predicts that later surprises have a larger impact on stock returns than do earlier surprises (the recency effect hypothesis).

9,"The paper analyzes the relationship between beta risk and aggregate market volatility for 12sized-based portfolios for the case of Malaysia using daily data from January 1988 to December 2000. The analysis is conducted for the entire sample as well as various sub-samples corresponding to (i)the upward trend in the market from January 1988-December 1992; (ii) the huge influx of portfolio investments from January 1993-June 1997, and (Hi) the Asian crisis and its aftermath from July 1997-December 2000. The results generally suggest instability in beta risk due to its significant response to aggregate market volatility. Additionally, we also note that the direction of relationship between beta risk and market volatility seems to depend on stock market conditions or sub-samples used. Namely, beta risk seems to decrease with increasing market volatility for the whole sample as well as the first and the third sub-samples. However, for the second sub-sample, their relationship turns to be positive. Lastly, the author have evidence for the Malaysian case that size does not play significant role in the way beta risk responds to aggregate market volatility.

9,"The objective of this study is to empirically examine a hypothesis that earnings quality enhances the ability of nonoperating income to predict future operating cash flow. The magnitude of income smoothing index, measured by Eckel’s (1981) index formula, is used to capture a firm’s quality level of earnings. Higher index is assumed to represent higher level of earnings quality. A linear regression model is developed to test the hypothesis. The model parameters are estimated based on sixty-two manufacturing firms listed in the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) up to the end of 1997. This study finds empirical evidence that supports the proposed hypothesis.

9,"This study adopts the error correction model to empirically investigate the role of real stock prices in the long run-money demand in the Malaysian financial or money market for the period 1977: Q1-1997: Q2. Specifically, an attempt is made to check whether the real narrow money (M1/P) is cointegrated with the selected variables like industrial production index (IPI), one-year T-Bill rates (TB12), and real stock prices (RSP). If a cointegration between the variables, i.e., the dependent and independent variables, is found to be the case, it may imply that there exists a long-run co-movement among these variables in the Malaysian money market. From the empirical results it is found that the cointegration between money demand and real stock prices (RSP) is positive, implying that in the long run there is a positive association between real stock prices (RSP) and demand for real narrow money (M1/P).

9,"On July 3, 2000, the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) reduced its tick size from Rp25.00 to Rp5.00. This study examines the impact of the tick size reduction on the JSX bid-ask spread, market depth, and trading activity. Using daily data, this study finds that the rupiah spread, percentage spread, and depth decreased significantly. All of these findings are not surprising since they are consistent with previous studies conducted in several different markets.In contrast to previous studies, this study finds that the key variable in determining the difference in performance of JSX stocks following the tick size reduction is the price of the stock. Specifically, all the trading activity measures e.g. in the number of trades, share volume, and rupiah volume, increased for low-priced stocks. Conversely, trading activity decreased for high-priced stocks. The possible explanation is that absolute tick size Rp5.00 is too small in economic terms for JSX high-priced stocks, so those decrease the investors’ willingness to trade.",The Impact of the Tick Size Reduction on Liquidity: Empirical Evidence from the Jakarta Stock Exchange,2004-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the impact of the tick size reduction on liquidity empirical evidence from the jakarta stock exchange on july the jakarta stock exchange jsx reduced its tick size from rp to rp this study examines the impact of the tick size reduction on the jsx bidask spread market depth and trading activity using daily data this study finds that the rupiah spread percentage spread and depth decreased significantly all of these findings are not surprising since they are consistent with previous studies conducted in several different markets in contrast to previous studies this study finds that the key variable in determining the difference in performance of jsx stocks following the tick size reduction is the price of the stock specifically all the trading activity measures e g in the number of trades share volume and rupiah volume increased for low-priced stocks conversely trading activity decreased for high-priced stocks the possible explanation is that absolute tick size rp is too small in economic terms for jsx high priced stocks so they decrease the investors willingness to trade,23387238,9

9,"This study was conducted to determine the critical components of a Total Quality Management program (referred to as TQM constructs) and the specific strategies, policies and programs that should comprise each TQM construct (referred to as TQM elements); and to validate these TQM constructs in selected companies in the Philippines. Development of the TQM constructs involved the theoretical derivation of the TQM constructs from literature. Validation of the TQM constructs involved a two-stage survey determining the critical components perceived important by managers and assessing the extent by which these critical TQM program components are adopted. Assessment of the instrument’s reliability was done through the Internal Consistency Method with Cronbach coefficient alpha as the relevant coefficient while content and construct validity were done through panel review and Exploratory Factor Analyses, respectively.Results of the first survey indicate a slight deviation in what is perceived as critical components of a quality management system vis-a-vis the original 72 TQM elements. In general, the elements pertaining to a TQM construct as theoretically derived no longer formed part of such construct but merged with other elements in another TQM construct where it shared similarity in functions. This implies that under Philippine context, especially when using perception of importance as the basis for scale development, the integration of activities, strategies and functions associated with TQM program adoption is perceived by respondent managers as more critical. The study presented the multi-functional and multi-dimensional aspects of the TQM constructs. The resulting 35 critical TQM items were further validated in Survey 2.

9,"According to Shaw (1973) and McKinnon (1973), the most important element of economic development is financial liberalization. This action will eliminate the distortion, as what the government of Indonesia did on June 1, 1983 through deregulation of banking. The government eliminated the ceiling of credit and gave a full authority to each bank to determine their interest rates. This study looks up to Fry (1995) model to test McKinnon-Shaw hypothesis. The models were regressed with dummy variable. This effort will give illustration or conclusion of the structural change, that happened specifically caused by environmental or policy changes.Generally, insignificant in the relationship between interest rates in national saving and investment in Indonesia could be caused by financial mechanisms those very long and complex channels. That is why real interest rates could not give effect to national saving directly. Export, especially from oil and gas and foreign debt were growth-stimulating factors. Meanwhile, money supply, which supported by tight money policy and balance budget policy caused Indonesian inflation along those periods. The periodically analysis shows that deregulation of June 1983(PAKJUN) were success to mobilize public fund, encourage investment on real sector, and increase the economic growth, but failed to control the inflation rate. The implementation of October 1988 deregulation (PAKTO) had flourished the establishment of new banks and created good competition among them. The competition had no longer on interest rate. Therefore, it can be said also the easy requirements of establishing banks become contra productive for PAKJUN policy, which had laid to the market mechanism.Basically, either PAKJUN or PAKTO was not policies in which urgently implemented in Indonesia. Those financial deregulations were not supported by the existence of deregulation on real sectors, so that the financial deregulations were not effective to achieve their goals.","Interest Rate Policy, Inflation and Economic Growth: A Policy Evaluation of Indonesia, 1969-1997",2004-09-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,interest rate policy inflation and economic growth a policy evaluation of Indonesia according to Shaw and Mckinnon the most important element of economic development is financial liberalization this action will eliminate the distortion as what the government of Indonesia did in June through deregulation of banking the government eliminated the ceiling of credit and gave a full authority to each bank to determine their interest rates this study looks up to fry model to test mckinnonshaw hypothesis the models were regressed with dummy variables this effort will give illustration or conclusion of the structural change that happened specifically caused by environmental or policy changes generally insignificant in the relationship between interest rates in national saving and investment in Indonesia could be caused by financial mechanisms those very long and complex channels that is why real interest rates could not give effect to national saving directly export especially from oil and gas and foreign debt were growth stimulating factors meanwhile money supply which was supported by tight money policy and balance budget policy caused Indonesian inflation along those periods the periodic analysis shows that deregulation of June Pakjun was successful to mobilize public funds encouraging investment on real sector and increasing the economic growth but failed to control the inflation rate the implementation of october deregulation pakto had flourished the establishment of new banks and created good competition among them the competition had no longer on interest rate therefore it can be said also the easy requirements of establishing banks became contra productive for pakjun policy which had laid to the market mechanism basically either pakjun or pakto was not policies in which urgently implemented in Indonesia those financial deregulations were not supported by the existence of deregulation on real sectors so that the financial deregulations were not effective to achieve their goals,23387238,9

Intragroup cooperation is a work setting when individuals in a group perceive that their goal attainments are positively related; while intragroup competition is a work setting when individuals in a group perceive that their goal attainments are negatively related. Performance is defined as group productivity level, speed of solving problems, and quality of the group outcomes.Meta-analytical method is used to test the hypothesis. The method combines and compares eight studies from various research disciplines i.e., education, psychology, organization, and business and accounting. The studies being analyzed also vary in terms of the research and experimental setting such as manufacturing operations and problem solving games.Meta-analytical study is relatively rare in Indonesia, so that this study is important to introduce and to show the importance and the benefit of the analysis for concluding a large number and different research in a similar domain of research question.  In a simple term, a meta-analysis is a quantitative literature review.

A QWL measure consisting of seven factors: growth and development, participation, physical environment, supervision, pay and benefit, social relevance, and workplace integration was developed based on Walton’s (1974) conception. The three-component model and measure of organizational commitment developed by Allen and Meyer (1990) was adopted in this study. Results of regression analysis indicated that only two QWL factors, growth and development and pay and benefit, were significant in explaining organizational commitment.

9,"This study examines a new attachment concept called job embeddedness as antecedent of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Firstly, we tested hypothesis concerning positive relationship between job embeddedness and OCB as predicted by Mitchell et al. (2001). Secondly, we tested hypothesis concerning the mediation effect of sense of responsibility in the relationship between job embeddedness and OCB.Nurses (N = 170) and their immediate supervisors ( N = 41) from five privately owned hospital in Jogjakarta participated in this study. Of 340 questionnaires distributed to the respondents, 339 were returned yielding a response rate of 99 percent. Of those returned, 300 questionnaires were available for further analyses. Nurses were asked to respond to a questionnaire of 40 items concerning perception of embeddedness and 4 item concerning sense of responsibility to their employing organization. Nurses’ citizenship behavior were measured using 12 items as rated by their immediate supervisors. The results support the hypothesis that job embeddedness correlates positively with OCB. However, our result failed to support the prediction of the mediating effect of employees’ sense of responsibility in causal relationship between job embeddedness and OCB.

9,"The clothing or garments industry has developed rapidly during the past some decades and has contributed to the economic growth of many nations, both developed and developing countries. This industry has been very much regulated by many bilateral agreements such as Multi Fiber Arrangement (MFA), a quota arrangement made by the importing countries. As MFA (quota regime) comes to an end by 2005 and integrates into the WTO regime, it will bring opportunities to highly competitive and proactive garment exporting countries whereas the challenges will be faced more by the less competitive countries. Issues related to environment and social compliance, technology requirements etc. have been brought into surface by the importing countries, which may worsen the condition. Under the above scenario, it is imperative that certain proactive measures be taken. Thus, the broad objective of this study is to analyze the response of the garment exporters from Indonesia towards the emerging issues related to environmental and social compliance, technology requirements etc. The present study is a questionnaire-based study. The samples have been selected from the Directories of largest exporters in the country. With reminders and persuasion, the final number of useable responses has been 115 Indonesian garment exporters. Seven factors of the emerging issues were identified by using factor analysis. In addition, factors of competitiveness, and the strategies adopted by the exporters have also been analyzed.

9,"The purpose of the study is to determine the relationships between belief, attitude, subjective norm, intention, and behavior towards the choice of infant food based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). An analysis on a sample of 108 mothers indicates that the TRA could be used in predicting choice decision of infant food formulas by explaining 57 percent of the variance in the behavioral intention. The subjective norm component had a higher predictive power than the attitudinal component. Of this normative component, parents or relatives and doctors were found to be more influential. Intention to choose an infant formula was also influenced by family income. The belief outcomes in evaluating a premium infant formula and economic infant formula were found to be different. For premium infant formula, brand trusted, closest to breast milk and nutrients content were identified as the dominant attributes. In contrast, availability, affordable, and nutrients content were identified as the prime beliefs in evaluating economic infant formula.

9,"Capturing growth opportunity has become a major integral activity of any port to sustain growth and competitive advantage. One of the famous strategies in leveraging sustainable growth and competitive advantage is the resource-based theory application into port strategic management, viewing resources of the port (internal and external) and its capabilities as the sources for achieving competitive advantage. In this study, we attempt to identify, exploit, and analyze growth opportunity of a Malaysian port from the perspective of the theory. We analyze the port’s resources in terms of values, uniqueness, inimitability, durability, and substitutability. The result is then compared with its rival ports in the region. This study recognizes that the port has successfully identified and exploited its resources for capturing growth opportunity and competing with other ports in the region. We perceive that the port will sustain its growth and competitive advantage as a major port in the region based on its current performance and rivalry circumstances.

9,"Both practitioners and academics demand a linkage model across financial markets, particularly among regional capital markets, for both risk management and portfolio selection purposes. Researchers frequently use cointegration and causality analysis in investigating the dependence or co-movement of three or more stock markets in different countries. However, they mostly conduct causality in mean tests but not causality in variance tests.This study assesses the cointegration and causal relations among seven developed Asian markets, i.e., Tokyo, Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, Shanghai, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges, using more frequent time series data. It employs the recently developed techniques for investigating unit roots, cointegration, time-varying volatility, and causality in variance.

9,"This study examines the impact of board size of Australian firms on Tobin’s Q. Agency theory suggests that there is an inverse relationship between board size and Tobin’s Q (Yermack 1996; Eisenberg et al. 1998). The resource dependence argument, however, hypothesizes that larger boards can lead to higher performance as the CEO’s need for advice is a function of the complexity of the organization (Pfeffer 1972; Klein 1998). Analyzing a panel data of 1,530 firm-year observations using random effects technique, this study finds a positive relationship between board size and Tobin’s Q. The random effects regression results also reveal that the positive relationship between board size and Tobin’s Q is driven by firm size as this positive relationship is only found in larger firm sample but not in the smaller firm sample.

9,"Children are a unique and also potential market. They are unique because they usually do not spend their own money but they may have high purchasing power back-up. They are potential because from the number of kids and the amount they spend, they are big and promising. Markets for kids consist of three markets: (1) primary market that targets the children itself, (2) influence market that emphasizes the influence that the children exert on family purchases, and (3) future market that considers the future market for the children. Based on the high potential market for the children, the author identifies the impacts of intention to consume for children on influence power (an effort pursued by kids in order to frequently and successfully influence parents or people surrounding them), impulsive buying (kids’ tendencies to buy spontaneously, immediately, and without any deep consideration), and autobiographical memory (a memory of previous experience that will be stored as a long-term memory). Furthermore, it is necessary to identify the antecedents of autobiographical memory for children. The results show that the intention to consume positively influences the impulsive buying as well as the autobiographical memory. For managerial implications, marketers need to put an emphasis on stimulating the intention to consume in order to create a positive autobiographical memory.",The Role of Intention to Consume  in Creating Autobiographical Memory,2008-09-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the role of intention to consume in creating autobiographical memory children are a unique and also their potential market is unique because they usually do not spend their own money but they may have high purchasing power reserves they are potential because from the number of children and the amount they spend they are big and promising markets for kids consist of three markets primary market that targets the children themselves influence market that emphasizes the influence that the children exert on family purchases and future market that considers the future market for the children based on the high potential market for the children the author identifies the impacts of intention to consume for children on influence power an effort pursued by kids in order to frequently and successfully influence parents or people around them impulsive buying kids tendencies to buy spontaneously immediately and without any deep consideration and autobiographical memory a memory of previous experience that will be stored as a long term memory furthermore it is necessary to identify the antecedents of autobiographical memory for children the results show that the intention to consume positively influences the impulsive buying as well as the autobiographical memory for managerial implications marketers need to put an emphasis on stimulating the intention to consume in order to create a positive autobiographical memory,23387238,9
9,"Since the pioneering work of Gurley and Shaw (1955), the attempt has been done to justify money as a primary focal point of macroeconomic theorizing. However, other researchers argue that variables such as financial development and indicators are also important to be linked with macroeconomic performance. Here, if money can be thought as means of production and consumer goods as the ultimate end toward which production is directed, and then capital also occupies a position that is both logically and temporarily intermediate between original means and ultimate ends. This temporarily intermediate status of capital is not in serious dispute, but its significance for macroeconomic theorizing is rarely recognized. The firms’ decision to acquire funds through debt and equity financings affects the capital structure, and, in the firm’s balance sheet, the impact of capital appears to influence the inventory investment. Hence, the significance of capital structure –induced inventory distortions in the context of firm-level is the basis for our article.

9,"This research examines financial ratios that distinguish between bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies and make use of those distinguishing ratios to build a one-year prior to bankruptcy prediction model. This research also calculates how many times the type I error is more costly compared to the type II error. The costs of type I and type II errors (cost of misclassification errors) in conjunction to the calculation of prior probabilities of bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy are used in the calculation of the ZETAc optimal cut-off score. The bankruptcy prediction result using ZETAc optimal cut-off score is compared to the bankruptcy prediction result using a cut-off score which does not consider neither cost of classification errors nor prior probabilities as stated by Hair et al. (1998), and for later purposes will be referred to Hair et al. optimum cutting score. Comparison between the prediction results of both cut-off scores is purported to determine the better cut-off score between the two, so that the prediction result is more conservative and minimizes expected costs, which may occur from classification errors.  This is the first research in Indonesia that incorporates type I and II errors and prior probabilities of bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy in the computation of the cut-off score used in performing bankruptcy prediction. Earlier researches gave the same weight between type I and II errors and prior probabilities of bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy, while this research gives a greater weigh on type I error than that on type II error and prior probability of non-bankruptcy than that on prior probability of bankruptcy.This research has successfully attained the following results: (1) type I error is in fact 59,83 times more costly compared to type II error, (2) 22 ratios distinguish between bankrupt and non-bankrupt groups, (3) 2 financial ratios proved to be effective in predicting bankruptcy, (4) prediction using ZETAc optimal cut-off score predicts more companies filing for bankruptcy within one year compared to prediction using Hair et al. optimum cutting score, (5) Although prediction using Hair et al. optimum cutting score is more accurate, prediction using ZETAc optimal cut-off score proved to be able to minimize cost incurred from classification errors.",BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION MODEL  WITH ZETAc OPTIMAL CUT-OFF SCORE  TO CORRECT TYPE I ERRORS,2005-06-05,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,bankruptcy prediction model with zetac optimal cutoff score to correct type i errors this research examines financial ratios that distinguish between bankrupt and nonbankrupt companies and make use of those distinguishing ratios to build a one year prior to bankruptcy prediction model this research also calculates how many times the type i error is more costly compared to the type ii error the costs of type i and type ii errors cost of misclassification errors in conjunction with the calculation of prior probabilities of bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy are used in the calculation of the zetac optimal cutoff score the bankruptcy prediction result using the zetac optimal cutoff score is compared to the bankruptcy prediction result using a cutoff score which does not consider neither cost of classification errors nor prior probabilities as stated by hair et al and for later purposes will be referred to hair et al optimum cutting score comparison between the prediction results of both cutoff scores is purported to determine the better cutoff score between the two so that the prediction result is more conservative and minimizes expected costs which may occur from classification errors this is the first research in indonesia that incorporates types i and ii errors and prior probabilities of bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy in the calculation of the cutoff score used in performing bankruptcy prediction earlier researches gave the same weight between type i and ii errors and prior probabilities of bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy while this research gives a greater weight on type i error than that on type ii error and prior probability of nonbankruptcy than that on prior probability of bankruptcy this research has successfully achieved the following results type i error is in fact times more costly compared to type ii error ratios distinguish between bankrupt and nonbankrupt groups financial ratios proved to be effective in predicting bankruptcy prediction using zetac optimal cutoff score predictions more companies filing for bankruptcy within one year compared to prediction using hair et al optimum cutting score although prediction using hair et al optimum cutting score is more accurate prediction using zetac optimal cutoff score proved to be able to minimize costs incurred from classification errors,23387238,9
9,"This study examines the variation in earnings-price ratios across Japanese and U.S. firms. The earnings-price ratio is one of the indicators often used by investors to determine their trading strategy. Previous literature document that Japanese firms have consistently lower earnings-price ratios than U.S. firms even though the earnings of Japanese firms have been adjusted to the U.S. GAAP. The objective of this study is to show that Japanese firms engage in income smoothing practices that stabilize earnings, thereby increasing Japanese investors’ willingness to pay higher prices for Japanese stocks. Comparing the income smoothing index and proportion of firms identified as smoothers shows that the intensity of Japanese firms practicing income-smoothing is greater than that of U.S. firms. The results also show that income-smoothing index is significant in explaining the cross-sectional variation of earnings-price ratios for Japanese firms but it is not significant for U.S. firms.  Two potential explanations for the results of U.S. firms are as follows.  First, income smoothing is not practiced widely across firms in the U.S.  Therefore, the variation of income smoothing does not explain the variation in the cross-sectional earnings-price ratios.  Second, even if U.S. firms practice income smoothing, the investors are aware of it and do not take earnings figures literally.Another results show that controlling for income smoothing does not eliminate the differences in the earnings-price ratios of the Japanese and U.S. firms. It is appropriate to conclude that although income smoothing plays a role in explaining the variations of earnings-price ratios across Japanese firms, it is not the only factor that contributes to the differences in the earnings-price ratios of Japanese and U.S. firms.  Other factors may play a role which are either country-specific (such as inflationary expectations, tax regimes) or firm-specific (such as quality of earnings, real returns) as suggested by Brown (1989).

9,"This research models trading behavior and examines the impact of heterogeneous expectations on asset prices. We extend Kyle’s (1985) one-period model to two-period model. The model shows that the informed trader takes into account not only the private information but also the pricing function. The price is an increasing function of the volatility of the asset value and decreasing in the volatility of uninformed traders’ demand. The costly information acquisition has an impact on the optimum demand but it has no direct impact on the price.We find the market depth is a linear function of the volatility of the uninformed traders and a weighted average of the total error variance of information. The depth is also decreasing in the volatility of the cash flow innovations. This argument is in line with the second finding, when the volatility of cash flow innovations increases, the value of risky asset becomes more volatile, and as a result the bigger are the advantages of having private information. Our research raises some questions for further investigation. We indirectly assume that the informed traders make a profit at the expense on the uninformed traders.

In order to analyze the output-price relationship across the countries and time periods, we adopt several tests including the Pearson correlation analysis, Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and Vector Error-Correction Model (VECM). The study documents that the output-price relationship has changed in several countries following the crisis in 1997/1998. While there is a clear business cycles synchronization between the ASEAN-5 countries in the short-run, results have been mixed in the long run.

9,"In recent time, Indian manufacturing has seen technologically intensive and resource optimization based initiatives to satisfy competitive urge and to build or sustain market position. This they do by developing products either strategically or innovatively, but that is hardly distinguished or seen as a separate approach to product development. Strategically, product development is resource optimization based while innovatively, it is product differentiation focused. This paper outlines the strategic and innovative approach to product development and analyzes sector specific role of each in product development. The study is undertaken with nine product development team-leaders and resource-heads, three of each from automobile, steel and textile. It is concluded that textile is strategically skewed toward product development whereas automobile is inclined towards innovative orientation.

9,"This study examines factors influencing organizational citizenship behavior in an organization. These factors include procedural justice, distributive justice, job satisfaction and commitment. Although previous studies have investigated commitment as antecedent of OCB, most of them did not specifically explain the type of commitment hypothesized. In terms of commitment, this study utilizes the specific type of commitment, i.e. affective commitment. The theoretical model proposes both distributive justice and procedural justice as antecedents of job satisfaction and job satisfaction has an effect on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) through affective commitment. SEM analysis of survey data from 383 nurses who are working for private hospitals in Indonesia supports that the theoretical model has met goodness-of-fit criterions. The findings concluded that there are significant relationships between both procedural justice and distributive justice and job satisfaction. Job satisfaction has a significant impact for developing affective commitment. The results also support that affective commitment is a significant predictor of organizational citizenship behavior.","A Test of the Relationships  among Perceptions of Justice,  Job Satisfaction, Affective Commitment and Organizational Citizenship Behavior",2005-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,a test of the relationships among perceptions of justice job satisfaction affective commitment and organizational citizenship behavior this study examines factors influencing organizational citizenship behavior in an organization these factors include procedural justice distributive justice job satisfaction and commitment although previous studies have investigated commitment as an antecedent of OCB most of them did not specifically explain the type of commitment hypothesized in terms of commitment this study utilizes the specific type of commitment i e affective commitment the theoretical model proposes both distributive justice and procedural justice as antecedents of job satisfaction and job satisfaction has an effect on organizational citizenship behavior OCB through affective commitment sem analysis of survey data from nurses who are working for private hospitals in Indonesia supports that the theoretical model has met goodness of fit criterias the findings concluded that there are significant relationships between both procedural justice and distributive justice and job satisfaction job satisfaction has a significant impact for developing affective commitment the results also support that affective commitment is a significant predictor of organizational citizenship behavior,23387238,9
9,"The economic and financial crises hitting Indonesia in 1997 have triggered a significant economic downturn. A critical issue addressed is how common shocks during crisis period have brought about macroeconomic outcome. The paper briefly discusses the problems, response and lessons learnt in the country’s effort to restore the economy to its long-term potential growth path. By examining balance sheet conditions across sectors in the economy, it is shown that even though some progress has been achieved, overall balance sheet conditions are still vulnerable to further shocks that may hit the economy, so that efforts to restore economic growth and stability face substantial challenges. Considering these constraints, Indonesian macroeconomic policy makers focus their efforts on strengthening financial markets, among others, by developing bond markets and implementing banking architecture.

A growing body of research in user acceptance of IT literature has limited focus on individual professionals as target users. Therefore, this research investigates how external variables, namely individual differences and system characteristics influence lecturers as individual professionals to accept the internet technology. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) are used as the main reference in this research. Findings of this research indicate that individual differences (computer self-efficacy, knowledge of search domain) and system characteristics (terminology, screen design, relevance) have indirect impact through perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude on lecturers’ intention to use the internet.

9,"This study explores the linkages between Deming’s Principle, World-Class Company, Operational Excellence, and Company Performance in the Indonesia’s oil and gas industry. The aim of this study is to examine the causal relationships model between the Deming’s Principle (DP), World-Class Company (WCC), Operational Excellence (OE), and Company Performance (Monetary Gain Performance or MGP and Value Gain Performance or VGP). The author used 140 strategic business units (SBUs) in 49 oil and gas companies in Indonesia. The survey was administered to every level of management at each SBU (Top, Middle, and Low Level Management). A multiple informant sampling unit is used to ensure a balanced view of the relationships between the research constructs, and to collect data from the most informed respondents on different levels of management. A total of 1,332 individual usable questionnaires were returned thus qualified for analysis, representing an effective response rate of 50.19 percent. Path analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) are used to analyze the effect of Deming’s principle on company performance and to investigate the interrelationships between Deming’s principle, world-class company, operational excellence, and company performance. The results show that Deming’s Principle has significant positive and indirect effect on company performance (monetary gain performance and value gain performance). Although the Deming’s Principle has no significant direct effects on company performance, the Deming’s Principle has significant positive effects on the intervening variables (world-class company and operational excellence). The result also shows that a complete model fit and the acceptable parameter level that indicate the overall parameter are good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. By concentrating on a single industry (oil and gas), SEM specification of the causal relationship model between five constructs can be more complete and specific because unique characteristics of the oil and gas industry can be included (upstream and downstream chain activities). Finally, the particular design of the research and the findings suggest that the structural model of the study has a great potential for replication to manufacturing as well as service operations.","Exploring the Linkages Between  Deming’s Principle, World-Class Company, Operational Excellence, and Company Performance in an Oil and  Gas Industry Setting",2005-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,exploring the linkages between Demings principle worldclass company operational excellence and company performance in an oil and gas industry setting this study the causal relationships model between the demings principle dp worldclass company wcc operational excellence oe and company performance monetary gain performance or mgp and value gain performance or vgp the author used strategic business units sbus in oil and gas companies in indonesia the survey was administered to every level of management at each sbu top middle and low level management a multiple informant sampling unit is used to ensure a balanced view of the relationships between the research constructs and to collect data from the most informed respondents on different levels of management a total of individual usable questionnaires were returned thus qualified for analysis representing an effective response rate of percent path analysis and structural equation modeling sem are used to analyze the effect of Demings principle on company performance and to investigate the interrelationships between Demings principle world class company operations excellence and company performance the results show that Deming's principle has significant positive and indirect effect on company performance monetary gain performance and value gain performance although the demings principle has no significant direct effects on company performance the demings principle has significant positive effects on the intervening variables world class company and operational excellence the result also shows that a complete model fit and the acceptable parameter level that indicates the overall parameters are good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data by concentrating on a single industry oil and gas sem specification of the causal relationship model between five constructs can be more complete and specific because unique characteristics of the oil and gas industry can be included upstream and downstream chain activities finally the particular design of the research and the findings suggest that the structural model of the study has a great potential for replication to manufacturing as well as service operations,23387238,9
9,"The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the simultaneity of corporate hedging and debt policies. Using a pooled sample of Indonesian non-financial listed firms covering the periods of 1996-2001, the present study finds evidence that corporate hedging and debt policies are simultaneously determined. That is, the use of debts motivate firms to hedge; but simultaneously, hedging increases debt capacity and induces firms to borrow more in order to take advantage of the tax benefits arising from additional debt capacity. Another important finding is that financially distressed firms –as indicated by their debt restructuring programs– are less motivated to hedge, because such firms will see that the option values of their equity will increase as their cash-flow volatilities increase. Therefore, financially distressed firms tend not to hedge; or at least, hedge lesser compared to those of firms that do not experience financial distress.",Investigating the Simultaneity  of Corporate Hedging and  Debt Policies: Empirical Evidence from Indonesia,2005-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,investigating the simultaneity of corporate hedging and debt policies empirical evidence from Indonesia the primary objective of this paper is to investigate the simultaneity of corporate hedging and debt policies using a pooled sample of Indonesian nonfinancial listed firms covering the periods of the present study finds evidence that corporate hedging and debt policies are simultaneously determined that is the use of debts motivates firms to hedge but simultaneously hedging increases debt capacity and induces firms to borrow more in order to take advantage of the tax benefits arising from additional debt capacity another important finding is that financially distressed firms as indicated by their debt restructuring programs are less motivated to hedge because such firms will see that the option values ​​of their equity will increase as their cash flow volatilities increase therefore financially distressed firms tend not to hedge or at least hedge less compared to those of firms that do not experience financial distress,23387238,9

9,"The furniture industry makes a significant contribution to the Indonesian economy but is exposed to an intensifying competitive environment and to emerging shortages of raw material. These circumstances have prompted small furniture manufacturers in the district of Jepara to undertake several types of innovation. It appears that of all first ranked innovations, product innovation is the largest category. In the overall pattern of innovations, market innovation and logistics innovation are also important, a situation that can be explained by the typical character and current circumstances of the furniture industry in this area. The innovation process concerned mainly relies on traditional knowledge sources, namely in-house learning-by-doing and experimentation, and buyers (customers). However, the manufacturers show willingness to use other knowledge sources in the near future, particularly more formal and globally oriented ones, such as exhibitions, research institutions, and the Internet. What tends to hamper such progress is that the manufacturers’ capability to access these knowledge sources is limited by financial obstacles and to a smaller extent by complexity and language obstacles. The paper concludes with a few policy recommendations and potential directions of future research. One of the policy recommendations aims at a combination of the traditional way of knowledge generation through in-house learning-by-doing and experimentation with knowledge from modern and formal sources.",Knowledge as a Critical Resource in Innovation among Small Furniture Companies in Indonesia: An Exploration,2005-09-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,knowledge as a critical resource in innovation among small furniture companies in Indonesia an exploration of the furniture industry makes a significant contribution to the Indonesian economy but is exposed to an intensifying competitive environment and to emerging shortages of raw materials these circumstances have prompted small furniture manufacturers in the district of Jepara to undertake several types of innovation it appears that of all first ranked innovations product innovation is the largest category in the overall pattern of innovations market innovation and logistics innovation are also important a situation that can be explained by the typical character and current circumstances of the furniture industry in this area the innovation process concerns mainly rely on traditional knowledge sources namely in-house learning by doing and experimentation and buyers customers however the manufacturers show willingness to use other knowledge sources in the near future particularly more formal and globally oriented ones such as exhibitions research institutions and the internet what tends to hamper such progress is that the manufacturers' capability to access these knowledge sources is limited by financial obstacles and to a smaller extent by complexity and language obstacles the paper concludes with a few policy recommendations and potential directions of future research one of the policy recommendations aims at a combination of the traditional way of knowledge generation through in-house learning by doing and experimentation with knowledge from modern and formal sources,23387238,9
9,A psychological contract is an implicit understanding between a group of employees and their employer that arose as a result of a particular leadership style. Psychological contract violation (PCV) is said to occur when there is a perceived breach of promise that leads to an emotional and affective response. The literature on PCV posits a number of antecedents and outcomes of PCV. This study seeks to develop a model of PCV by linking it with justice and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). It is argued that the antecedents of PCV lead to a sense of  injustice. These will then create the emotional response that is indicative of PCV. It is also argued that an outcome of this PCV experience is reduced OCB and the emergence of a new outlook towards employment relationship. Data was collected from a Malaysian company that initiated a voluntary separation scheme as part of an effort to downsize its work force.

9,"This study investigates the moderating impacts of hierarchical level of managers’ abilities on the form and strength of all structural relationships between quality management practices and company financial performance. This study describes the structural relationships among the research constructs —six critical factors of quality management practices (quality improvement program, supervisory leadership, supplier involvement, management commitment, training to improve products/services, cross-functional relationships); the contextual factors of oil and gas companies—world-class performance in operations (world-class company practices, operational excellence practices, company non-financial performance); and company financial performance. It uses a sample of 1,332 managers in 140 strategic business units (SBUs) within 49 oil and gas companies operating in Indonesia. The empirical results indicate that the goodness-of-fit of the unconstrained model is much better than that of the constrained model, and this is an indicator that hierarchical level of managers’ abilities moderates all structural relationships among the research constructs. Hence, the hierarchical level of managers’ abilities acts as a moderating variable of the whole model (i.e., among critical factors of quality management practices, world-class company practices, operational excellence practices, company non-financial performance, and company financial performance). It means that the major contribution of the hierarchical level of managers’ abilities is how to make changes in the organizational system. Top level managers’ abilities are deemed the most capable of making significant changes because of their broad sources of power and influence. Conversely, lower level managers’ abilities find it more difficult making significant changes in the system because of bureaucratic control processes that limit their actions —powerlessness or a chronic lack of autonomy. Compared to the hierarchical level of managers’ abilities, the degree of autonomy may be a more comprehensive contribution in reference to managers’ abilities to influence an organizational system. Autonomy may not only act as a person enhancer to increase internal work motivation, but it may also serve to moderate the extent to which individuals are able to significantly influence a system. In addition, involvement and empowerment of all organizational members (including managers) in cooperative and collaborative (interactive) efforts to achieve quality improvements appear to be a key element to TQM. Results further reveal that world-class performance in operations (world-class company practices, operational excellence practices, and company non-financial performance) positively mediates the impact of critical factors of quality management practices on company financial performance. Results also point out that three out of six critical factors of quality management practices are positively associated with world-class company practices and operational excellence practices under the moderating of hierarchical level of managers’ abilities. World-class company practices and operational excellence practices have direct and significant effects on company non-financial performance. Furthermore, empirical results suggest that there is a positive and significant relationship between company non-financial performance and company financial performance.",Hierarchical level  oF managers’ abilities: A Moderator between Quality Management Practices and Company Financial Performance,2007-09-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,hierarchical level of managers abilities a moderator between quality management practices and company financial performance this study investigates the moderating impacts of hierarchical level of managers abilities on the form and strength of all structural relationships between quality management practices and company financial performance this study describes the structural relationships among the research constructs six critical factors of quality management practices quality improvement program supervisory leadership supplier involvement management commitment training to improve products services crossfunctional relationships the contextual factors of oil and gas companies worldclass performance in operations worldclass company practices operational excellence practices company nonfinancial performance and company financial performance it uses a sample of managers in strategic business units sbus within oil and gas companies operating in indonesia the empirical results indicate that the goodness of fit of the unconstrained model is much better than that of the constrained model and this is an indicator that hierarchical level of managers abilities moderates all structural relationships among the research constructs hence the hierarchical level of managers abilities acts as a moderating variable of the whole model i e among critical factors of quality management practices worldclass company practices operational excellence practices company nonfinancial performance and company financial performance it means that the major contribution of the hierarchical level of managers abilities is how to make changes in the organizational system top level managers abilities are deemed the most capable of making significant changes because of their broad sources of power and influence conversely lower level managers abilities find it more difficult making significant changes in the system because of bureaucratic control processes that limit their actions powerlessness or a chronic lack of autonomy compared to the hierarchical level of managers' abilities the degree of autonomy may be a more comprehensive contribution in reference to managers' abilities to influence an organizational system autonomy may not only act as a person enhancer to increase internal work motivation but it may also serve to moderate the extent to which individuals are able to significantly influence a system in addition to involvement and empowerment of all organizational members including managers in cooperative and collaborative interactive efforts to achieve quality improvements appear to be a key element to tqm results further reveal that worldclass performance in operations worldclass company practices operational excellence practices and company nonfinancial performance positively mediates the impact of critical factors of quality management practices on company financial performance results also point out that three out of six critical factors of quality management practices are positively associated with world class company practices and operational excellence practices under the moderating of hierarchical level of managers' abilities worldclass company practices and operational excellence practices have direct and significant effects on company nonfinancial performance furthermore empirical results suggest that there is a positive and significant relationship between company nonfinancial performance and company financial performance,23387238,9

Unfortunately, gaining a loyal customer is not a trivial activity since there are gaps to understand consumer experience comprehensively.

9,"Investigations to determine whether program perceived value could influence program satisfaction, program card loyalty and store loyalty are critical to elucidate the roles and significance of the constructs and advancing management practice. Accordingly, in line with this research direction, this study aims to assess the effects of program perceived value offered by few leading retail superstores and departmental stores in Malaysia on its members’ loyalty towards the store. The data set utilized in this study has been obtained via quota sampling technique, where a sample of 153 retail loyalty programs’ members was analyzed. An integrative conceptual model was developed and tested using Structural Equation Modeling using AMOS program. The results exemplify that program perceived value is a strong driver of program satisfaction and program card loyalty. Unexpectedly, program perceived value is not a significant predictor of store loyalty but, it has an indirect effect on store loyalty mediated by program satisfaction. Continuous plea in marketing management is to make marketing instruments more efficient. In recent years introduction of customer relationship marketing instruments is strongly advocated, both in marketing theory and practice. Several researchers (e.g., Berry 1983; Berry and Parasuraman 1991; and Gronroos, 1994) have changed the focus of a marketing orientation from attracting short-term, discrete transactional customers to retaining long-lasting, intimate customer relationships. In fact Roberts, Varki, Brodie (2003), further suggested that it is best to describe relationship marketing as the formation of “bonds” between the company and the customer. Achieving an effective relationship in a consumer context is considered to be even more challenging than it is in a business-to-business context, given the generally more polygamous character of consumers as opposed to business customers (Keng and Ehrenberger 1984; Pressey and Matthews 1998).",Program Perceived Value and Program Satisfaction Influences on Store Loyalty: Insights from Retail Loyalty Progam,2007-09-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,program perceived value and program satisfaction influences on store loyalty insights from retail loyalty program investigations to determine whether program perceived value could influence program satisfaction program card loyalty and store loyalty are critical to elucidate the roles and significance of the constructs and advancing management practice accordingly in line with this research direction this study aims to assess the effects of the perceived value program offered by several leading retail superstores and departmental stores in Malaysia on its members' loyalty towards the store the data set utilized in this study has been obtained via quota sampling technique where a sample of retail loyalty programs members was analyzed an integrative conceptual model was developed and tested using structural equation modeling using amos program the results exemplify that program perceived value is a strong driver of program satisfaction and program card loyalty unexpectedly program perceived value is not a significant predictor of store loyalty but it has an indirect effect on store loyalty mediated by program satisfaction continuous plea in marketing management is to make marketing instruments more efficient in recent years introduction of customer relationship marketing instruments is strongly advocated both in marketing theory and practice several researchers e g berry berry and parasuraman and gronroos have changed the focused of a marketing orientation from attracting shortterm discrete transactional customers to retain long-lasting intimate customer relationships in fact roberts varki brodie further suggested that it is best to describe relationship marketing as the formation of bonds between the company and the customer achieving an effective relationship in a consumer context is considered to be even more challenging than it is in a business-to-business context given the generally more polygamous character of consumers as opposed to business customers keng and ehrenberger pressey and matthews,23387238,9
9,"This paper aims to analyze Indonesian position among the trading behavior in four selected ASEAN countries (according to their import-and-export products) using cointegration analysis. The demands for export and import are estimated before the monetary crisis erupted (1963 – 1995) using the dynamic OLS (DOLS) method. The Johansen Maximum Likelihood (JML) approach is also employed to compare the results obtained. The results show that foreign income has a significant impact on export demand, suggesting that foreign disturbance in the form of economic activities is likely to be transmitted to these countries. The Marshall Lerner conditions are easily met for the cases of Malaysia and Thailand (DOLS and JML). For Indonesia and the Philippines, the sum of the price elasticities of export and import demand are less than unity. This can be explained by the J-curve, in which the currency depreciations will first worsen the trade balance before it improves, and it takes a long time to affect the trade balance.",Cointegration analysis  on trading behavior  in four SELECTED asean countries BEFORE MONETARY CRISIS,2007-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,cointegration analysis on trading behavior in four selected asean countries before monetary crisis this paper aims to analyze indonesian position among the trading behavior in four selected asean countries according to their import and export products using cointegration analysis the demands for export and import are estimated before the monetary crisis erupted using the dynamic ols dols method the johansen maximum likelihood jml approach is also employed to compare the results obtained the results show that foreign income has a significant impact on export demand suggests that foreign disturbance in the form of economic activities is likely to be transmitted to these countries the marshall lerner conditions are easily met for the cases of malaysia and thailand dols and jml for indonesia and the philippines the sum of the price elasticities of export and import demand are less than unity this can be explained by the jcurve in which the currency depreciations will first worsen the trade balance before it improves and it takes a long time to affect the trade balance,23387238,9
9,"The purpose of this study is to examine how leader-member exchange (LMX) similarity might affect exchange quality between coworkers. This research also investigates the relationships of LMX and CWX (coworker exchange) to employees’ organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Each respondent from 76 nurses at three hospitals in Semarang were asked to rate the quality of the relationship he/she had with his/her supervisor, resulting in 76 LMX ratings. They were also asked to rate the quality of their relationships with each of their coworkers. A dyad was created where we had complete information on two employees rating one another. Once paired, a total of 146 dyads with complete LMX, CWX, and work attitude data were acquired. The results of this research indicate that the interaction between two coworkers’ LMX scores predicts CWX quality for the coworker dyad. After controlling for CWX, LMX quality is positively related to job satisfaction, but not to organizational commitment. Furthermore, after controlling for LMX, a greater diversity in a worker’s CWX relationship is negatively associated to his/her organizational commitment, but not to his/her job satisfaction. The interaction of CWX quality and CWX diversity, however, does not predict work attitude.","Coworker Exchange, Leader-Member Exchange, and  Work Attitudes:P A Study of Coworker Dyads",2007-05-18,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,coworker exchange leadermember exchange and work attitudesp a study of coworker dyads the purpose of this study is to examine how leadermember exchange lmx similarity might affect exchange quality between coworkers each respondent from nurses at three hospitals in semarang were asked to rate the quality of the relationship he had with his supervisor resulting in lmx ratings they were also asked to rate the quality of their relationship with each of their coworkers a dyad was created where we had complete information on two employees rating one another once paired a total of dyads with complete lmx cwx and work attitude data were obtained the results of this research indicate that the interaction between two coworkers lmx scores predicts cwx quality for the coworker dyad after controlling for cwx lmx quality is positively related to job satisfaction but not to organizational commitment furthermore after controlling for lmx a greater diversity in a worker cwx relationship is negatively related to hisher organizational commitment but not to hisher job satisfaction the interaction of cwx quality and cwx diversity however does not predict work attitude,23387238,9
9,"This paper empirically examines the short- and long-run relationships between financial development and economic growth during the post-1997 financial crisis in Indonesia by employing a battery of times-series techniques, such as Autoregressive Dis-tributed Lag (ARDL) model, vector error correction model (VECM), variance decompositions (VDCs), and impulse-response functions (IRFs). Based on the ARDL (2, 0, 1, 2) model, the study finds that there exists a long-run equilibrium between economic growth and financial depth, share of investment, and inflation. In the long run, inflation is found to be the only variable which significantly (negatively) affects economic growth, implying a crucial role of maintaining a low rate of inflation in promoting the economic growth in the country. As for the dynamic causalities among the variables, the study finds the bidirectional causation between economic growth and investment, while the unidirectional causation is only found running from financial depth to investment. The finding of independence between economic growth and financial development supports the view of “the independent hypothesis” of Lucas (1988). Finally, based on VDCs and IRFs, the study documents that the variations in the economic growth respond more to shocks in the price stability (inflation), followed by investment and financial development. Our findings indicate that if policy makers want to promote growth, attention should be focused on long-run policies, i.e., maintaining the low rate of inflation.",Re-Examining  the Finance-Growth Nexus:  Empirical Evidence from Indonesia,2007-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,reexamining the financegrowth nexus empirical evidence from Indonesia this paper empirically examines the short and long run relationships between financial development and economic growth during the post financial crisis in Indonesia by employing a battery of times series techniques such as autoregressive distributed lag ardl model vector error correction model vecm variance decompositions vdcs and impulseresponse functions irfs based on the ardl model the study finds that there exists a long-run equilibrium between economic growth and financial depth share of investment and inflation in the long run inflation is found to be the only variable which significantly negatively affects economic growth implying a crucial role of maintaining a low rate of inflation in promoting the economic growth in the country as for the dynamic causalities among the variables the study finds the bidirectional causation between economic growth and investment while the unidirectional causation is only found running from financial depth to investment the finding of independence between economic growth and financial development supports the view of the independent hypothesis of lucas finally based on vdcs and irfs the study documents that the variations in the economic growth respond more to shocks in the price stability inflation followed by investment and financial development our findings indicate that if policy makers want to promote growth attention should be focused on long-run policies i e maintaining the low rate of inflation,23387238,9

In order to measure the cost, this study estimates the annualized changes in industry-adjusted operation profit and sales from a year before the onset of distress to the resolution year. Using those approaches, the median of indirect financial distress cost is estimated between three and 11 percent annually. To the extent that the direct cost of financial distress reduces reported operating income, the estimated costs are overstated. The simple regressions analysis suggest that the indirect cost of financial distress significantly increases with size, leverage, number of creditors, and poor industry performance, but is not related to degree of bank loan reliance. The findings provide a weak support for the financial distress theory which suggests that conflicts of interest render the costs of financial distress.",The Indirect Costs  of Financial Distress in Indonesia,2007-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the indirect costs of financial distress in indonesia this paper presents quantitative estimates of the indirect costs of financial distress and its determinants in order to measure the costs this study estimates the annualized changes in industry adjusted operation profit and sales from a year before the onset of distress to the resolution year using those approaches the median of indirect financial distress cost is estimated between three and percent annually to the extent that the direct cost of financial distress reduces reported operating income the estimated costs are overstated the simple regressions analysis suggests that the indirect cost of financial distress significantly increases with leverage size number of creditors and poor industry performance but is not related to degree of bank loan reliance the findings provide a weak support for the financial distress theory which suggests that conflicts of interest render the costs of financial distress,23387238,9
9,"By abolishing the tax credit on dividends received by tax-exempt financial institutions in 1997, the effective rate of tax for share-holders such as pension funds increases significantly, and the tax preference for dividends is significantly reduced. The tax-exempt shareholders mainly consist of pension funds and insurance companies with respect to their pension business. This tax-exempt community is the most influential shareholders in many U.K. companies, and their tax preference for dividends may have an important impact on corporate dividend policy.The objective of this study is to examine whether the aggregate dividend payment changes following the 1997 abolition of the tax credit. Using aggregate data in time series from 1974 to 1999, this study finds that the percentage of forecast error in Lintner’s model does not change significantly between the pre- and post-abolition periods. Hence, there is no evidence that aggregate dividend payment decreases following the abolition of tax credit. This could be interpreted that the aggregate sample of U.K. firms indicates a little intention of changing their dividend policies in response to the abolition of tax credit.This study also investigates whether individual U.K. companies respond to the 1997 abolition of tax-credit. The test results show that the majority of companies in the sample do not change their dividend policies after the abolition of tax credit. It is possible that companies are reluctant to cut their dividend payment since the existing dividend payout could be sustained in the long-run. They also avoid sending negative signals to the market. Thus, companies typically chose to keep a dividend level relatively stable following the tax change in 1997. Only the minority of the U.K. companies experience a decline in their dividend payment. This evidence supports the hypothesis that the abolition of tax credit on dividends results in a decrease in aggregate dividend payment in order to satisfy a tax clientele.",The Response of Corporate Dividend Policy to The Abolition of Tax Credit in the United Kingdom (U.K.),2007-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the response of corporate dividend policy to the abolition of tax credit in the united kingdom u k by abolishing the tax credit on dividends received by taxexempt financial institutions in the effective rate of tax for shareholders such as pension funds increases significantly and the tax preference for dividends is reduced the taxexempt shareholders mainly consist of pension funds and insurance companies with respect to their pension business significantly this taxexempt community is the most influential shareholders in many u k companies and their tax preference for dividends may have an important impact on corporate dividend policy the objective of this study is to examine whether the aggregate dividend payment changes following the abolition of the tax credit using aggregate data in time series from to this study finds that the percentage of forecast error in Lintner's model does not change significantly between the pre and postabolition periods therefore there is no evidence that aggregate dividend payments decreased following the abolition of tax credit this could be interpreted that the aggregate sample of u k firms indicated a slight intention of changing their dividend policies in response to the abolition of tax credit this study also investigated whether individual u k companies responded to the abolition of taxcredit the test results show that the majority of companies in the sample do not change their dividend policies after the abolition of tax credit it is possible that companies are reluctant to cut their dividend payments since the existing dividend payout could be sustained in the long run they also avoid sending negative signals to the market so companies typically choose to keep a dividend level relatively stable following the tax change in only the minority of the UK companies experience a decline in their dividend payments this evidence supports the hypothesis that the abolition of tax credits on dividends results in a decrease in aggregate dividend payments in order to satisfy a tax clientele,23387238,9

9,"An event study window analysis of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is employed in this study to investigate the effect of mergers and acquisitions on Singaporean domestic banking groups’ efficiency. The results suggest that the mergers have resulted in a higher post-merger mean overall efficiency of Singaporean banking groups. However, from the scale efficiency perspective, our findings do not support further consolidation in the Singaporean banking sector. We find mixed evidence of the efficiency characteristics of the acquirers and targets banks. Hence, the findings do not fully support the hypothesis that a more (less) efficient bank becomes the acquirer (target).

9,"An earlier study on the determinants of inventories investment has been proposed by Lovel (1961). However, the study fails to mention the effects of financial variables. The puzzle prevails on account of imperfect capital markets. This implies that interest rate generally affects inventory investment indirectly through the debt channel. For instance, in the period of tight monetary policy, increasing interest rates have a negative impact on the present value of firms’ collateralizable net worth. In addition, they also weaken firms’ balance sheets as interest expenses also rise up. In imperfect capital markets, this fact indicates an increase in the amount of external financing that firms need, a rise in the premium on external financing that they face, and a reduction in their accumulation of assets, their spending and their production. Given the low adjustment cost that characterizes firms, it will be inventories that firms will initially reduce. Therefore, this paper is contributes to the issue of monetary policy transmission in Malaysia. Our specific attention is limited to the channel of monetary policy on a firm’s inventory. Using micro data, we try to take into account the relevance of the firm’s balance sheet conditions in the transmission of monetary policy.","Monetary Policy, Debt and  the Cyclical Behavior  of Inventories",2007-01-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,monetary policy debt and the cyclical behavior of inventories an earlier study on the determinants of inventory investment has been proposed by lovel however the study fails to mention the effects of financial variables the puzzle prevails on account of imperfect capital markets this implies that interest rate generally affects inventory investment indirectly through the debt channel for instance in the period of tight monetary policy increasing interest rates have a negative impact on the present value of firms collateralizable net worth in addition they also weaken balance sheets as interest expenses also rise up in imperfect capital markets this fact indicates an increase in the amount of external financing that firms need a rise in the premium on external financing that they face and a reduction in their accumulation of assets their spending and their production given the low adjustment costs that characterize firms it will be inventories that firms will initially reduce therefore this paper is contributed to the issue of monetary policy transmission in Malaysia our specific attention is limited to the channel of monetary policy on a firms inventory using micro data we try to take into account the relevance of the firms balance sheet conditions in the transmission of monetary policy,23387238,9

The proposed model, with satisfaction as a mediator between quality and loyalty, is found to be an acceptable representation of data across three brands of teh botol and for both comparative and noncomparative evaluation. The use of relative attitude, however, indicates a much stronger relationship amongst perceived quality, satisfaction, and loyalty than the attitude towards a brand when they are performed in individual evaluation.

The disclosure score range is between 3 percent and 49 percent with the mean and median score of 25 percent and 26 percent, respectively, at the onset of distress. The score is measured as the ratio of the total items disclosed to the maximum possible items score applicable to the firm. The most disclosed items are in the category of financial highlights and general corporate information whereas the three least disclosed items concern projections, liquidity, and research and development. Moreover, the results of this study reveal that the level of voluntary disclosure in the financially distressed firms is higher than that in non-financially distressed firms. There is no significant difference between the types of information disclosed by the 2  groups. The statistical tests are applied for various years.

9,"This paper examines long run co-movements between Malaysian stock market and the two largest stock markets in the world: the U.S. and Japan. By employing time-series analysis, i.e., cointegration, variance decompositions, and impulse response functions, the paper seeks to investigate which market actually leads the Malaysian stock market before, during, and after the 1997 Asian financial crisis periods. The results indicate that there is a co-movement of these markets only in the post crisis period. The Japanese stock market is found to significantly move the Malaysian stock market compared to U.S. stock market for the post-crisis period. At the same time, there seems to be a growing proportion of bilateral trade between Malaysia and Japan during the mentioned period. This finding seems to be consistent with the view that the stronger the bilateral trade ties between two countries, the higher the degree of co-movements (Masih and Masih 1999; Bracker et al. 1999; Pretorius 2002; Ibrahim 2003; Kearney and Lucey 2004).

9,"This study extends the prior research (Zahra and Das 1993) by examining the association between a company’s innovation strategy and its non-financial performance in the upstream and downstream strategic business units (SBUs) of oil and gas companies. The sequential model suggests a causal sequence among six dimensions of innovation strategy (leadership orientation, process innovation, product/service innovation, external innovation source, internal innovation source, and investment) that may lead to higher company non-financial performance (productivity and operational reliability). The study distributed a questionnaire (by mail, e-mailed web system, and focus group discussion) to three levels of managers (top, middle, and first-line) of 49 oil and gas companies with 140 SBUs in Indonesia. These qualified samples fell into 47 upstream (supply-chain) companies with 132 SBUs, and 2 downstream (demand-chain) companies with 8 SBUs. A total of 1,332 individual usable questionnaires were returned thus qualified for analysis, representing an effective response rate of 50.19 percent. The researcher conducts structural equation modeling (SEM) and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to assess the goodness-of-fit between the research models and the sample data and to test whether innovation strategy mediates the impact of leadership orientation on company non-financial performance. SEM reveals that the models have met goodness-of-fit criteria, thus the interpretation of the sequential models fits with the data. The results of SEM and hierarchical multiple regression: (1) support the importance of innovation strategy as a determinant of company non-financial performance, (2) suggest that the sequential model is appropriate for examining the relationships between six dimensions of innovation strategy and company non-financial performance, and (3) show that the sequential model provides additional insights into the indirect contribution of the individual dimensions of innovation strategy (partially mediators) to company non-financial performance —productivity or operational reliability. The findings provide empirical evidence extending the previous model of Zahra and Das. These findings also provide a basis for useful recommendations to upstream and downstream SBU managers attempting to implement a sequential model of innovation strategy —company non-financial performance links. This study shows that upstream SBUs rely on external innovation sources. They will acquire innovation policies through business partnership development (such as Joint Operation Body for Enhanced Oil Recovery or JOB-EOR, Joint Operation Body for Production Sharing Contract or JOB-PSC); licensing agreements (Technical Assistance Contract or TAC, Consortium Cooperation System); or acquisition with other firms (Joint Operating Contract or JOC). In contrast, downstream SBUs emphasize on generating internal innovation sources to develop their own in-house R&D efforts. The downstream SBUs should make extensive policies of internal innovation sources in their attempts to control the distribution of oil-based fuel and transmission of natural gas for domestic and international markets effectively. Both policies would enhance understanding and ultimately contribute to the improvement of company financial performance —sales, net profit margin, return on assets.",A SEQUENTIAL MODEL OF INNOVATION STRATEGY—COMPANY NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE LINKS,2006-05-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,a sequential model of innovation strategycompany nonfinancial performance links this study extends the prior research zahra and das by examining the association between a company's innovation strategy and its nonfinancial performance in the upstream and downstream strategic business units sbus of oil and gas companies the sequential model suggests a causal sequence among six dimensions of innovation strategy leadership orientation process innovation product service innovation external innovation source internal innovation source and investment that may lead to higher company nonfinancial performance productivity and operational reliability the study distributed a questionnaire by mail emailed web system and focus group discussion to three levels of managers top middle and firstline of oil and gas companies with sbus in Indonesia these qualified samples fell into upstream supply chain companies with sbus and downstream demand chain companies with sbus a total of individual usable questionnaires were returned thus qualified for analysis representing an effective response rate of percent the researcher conducts structural equation modeling sem and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to assess the goodness of fit between the research models and the sample data and to test whether innovation strategy mediates the impact of leadership orientation on company nonfinancial performance sem reveals that the models have met goodness of fit criteria thus the interpretation of the sequential models fits with the data the results of sem and hierarchical multiple regression support the importance of innovation strategy as a determinant of company nonfinancial performance suggest that the sequential model is appropriate for examining the relationships between six dimensions of innovation strategy and company nonfinancial performance and show that the sequential model provides additional insights into the indirect contribution of the individual dimensions of innovation strategy partially mediators to company nonfinancial performance productivity or operational reliability the findings provide empirical evidence extending the previous model of zahra and das these findings also provide a basis for useful recommendations to upstream and downstream SBU managers attempting to implement a sequential model of innovation strategy company nonfinancial performance links this study shows that upstream SBU managers rely on external innovation sources they will acquire innovation policies through business partnership development such as joint operation body for enhanced oil recovery or job or joint operation body for production sharing contract or job psc licensing agreements technical assistance contract or tac consortium cooperation system or acquisition with other firms joint operating contract or joc in contrast downstream sbus emphasize on generating internal innovation sources to develop their own inhouse rd efforts the downstream sbus should make extensive policies of internal innovation sources in their attempts to control the distribution of oilbased fuel and transmission of natural gas for domestic and international markets effectively both policies would enhance understanding and ultimately contribute to the improvement of company financial performance sales net profit margin return on assets,23387238,9

9,"This paper attempts to investigate interdependent mechanism among leverage, dividend, and managerial ownership policies. This paper considers firm size and economic conditions to control their effect on the relationship among the three policies. The interrelationship between leverage, dividend, and managerial ownership policies will be tested using two-stage least squares. Five exogenous variables are employed in simultaneous equation: current assets and structure of assets as leverage determinants, book to market and return on investment as dividend determinants, and relative return to risk as managerial ownership determinant. The research employs year 1994-2004 data, with 1717 firm years. The research findings can be summarised as follows. First, there is a negative relationship between managerial ownership and leverage policies as suggested by agency theory. Second, there is a relationship between managerial ownership and dividend policies, but the relationship between leverage and dividend is insignificant. Third, the relationship between leverage and dividend is insensitive to economic condition and firm size. Fourth, all exogenous variables have significant effect on endogenous variables, except relative return. Fifth, the effects of exogenous variables are not sensitive to control variables.

9,"The ex-dividend day returns are composed of the capital gains component and the dividends component. This study mainly examines the relationship between the 1997 abolition of the tax-credit and the ex-dividend day abnormal stock returns in the UK market (London Stock Exchange). The 1997 abolition of the tax credit on dividend effectively reduced the income of pension funds and other tax-exempt shareholders who had a strong preference for dividends. This study finds that the ex-day abnormal returns (AR) declined from +0.0580 percent during the pre-abolition periods to -0.1459 percent during the post-abolition periods. This decline is statistically significant with a t-value of 2.0431. From these results it would appear that the ex-dividend day AR changed following the 1997 abolition of tax credits on dividends. Moreover the comparison tests of ex-day drop-off ratios between pre-and post-abolition periods show that drop-off ratios for all dividend yield groups increased significantly from 0.519 in the pre-abolition periods to 0.574 over the post-abolition periods with a t-value of 2.183. Thus, the decrease on ex-day AR was further supported by a significant increase in the average price-drop to dividend ratios.The decline in the ex-day AR for the post-abolition periods seems to be driven primarily by quintile 5 (the highest dividend yield quintile). Quintile 5 exhibits strong dividend preference and this preference is likely caused  by the  imputation system that provides a tax advantage to the tax exempt shareholders. This finding appears to suggest that the highest dividend yield securities are likely to be held by tax-exempt investors such as pension funds that were affected by the abolition of the tax credits on dividend.",The Impact of the Abolition of tax credit on ex-dividend day abnormal returns  in the united kingdom (uk) market,2006-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the impact of the abolition of tax credit on exdividend day abnormal returns in the united kingdom uk market the exdividend day returns are composed of the capital gains component and the dividends component this study mainly examines the relationship between the abolition of the tax credit and the exdividend day abnormal stock returns in the UK market London stock exchange the abolition of the tax credit on dividends effectively reduced the income of pension funds and other tax exempt shareholders who had a strong preference for dividends this study finds that the exday abnormal returns ar declined from + percent during the preabolition periods to percent during the postabolition periods this decline is statistically significant with a tvalue of from these results it would appear that the exdividend day ar changed following the abolition of tax credits on dividends moreover the comparison tests of exday dropoff ratios between pre and postabolition periods show that dropoff ratios for all dividend yield groups increased significantly from in the preabolition periods to over the postabolition periods with a tvalue of thus the decrease on exday ar was further supported by a significant increase in the average price drop to dividend ratios the decline in the exday ar for the postabolition periods seems to be driven primarily by quintile the highest dividend yield quintile quintile exhibits strong dividend preference and this preference is likely caused by the imputation system that provides a tax advantage to the tax exempt shareholders this finding appears to suggest that the highest dividend yield securities are likely to be held by tax exempt investors such as pension funds that were affected by the abolition of the tax credits on dividends,23387238,9

Based on foreign trade data, the method uses indicators, which allow a product specific cross-section and longitudinal-section valuation of the international competitiveness and the supplied product quality of all potential supplier countries. The method thus provides a variety of information for procurement departments, including the present level and the dynamic of competitiveness and product quality for the potential supplier countries within every product group of the international product nomenclature (Combined System and the Harmonised System). Potential supplier countries --the companies of which have proven to be particularly competitive in the different product quality stages-- are identified. This pre-selection of countries enables the companies to limit their search for potential suppliers to the selected supplier countries.

9,"Few studies have been conducted on how farmers’ entrepreneurship affects their farm performance. However, factors of entrepreneurship have not been adequately explored by researchers. Textbooks and articles on farm management usually stress the importance of farmers’ management capability with respect to their farm output. Unfortunately, they have failed to relate management capability to entrepreneurship. This study was conducted using a multilevel analysis with Structural Equation Model (SEM) to know the causal relationships among environment factors such as the country’s economy, natural resources, institutions and organizations, individual backgrounds, entrepreneurship, management capacity, and farm performance. The cross-sectional data was obtained in 2003 from four dominant tobacco-producing districts in Central Java. The multilevel model –that relates external environment, entrepreneurship, and management capacity– can adequately represent the data to estimate farm performance.The results of the analysis indicate that factors like personal aspects, together with physical, economic and institutional environments, affect farmers’ entrepreneurship.

9,"This study provides evidence on the cross sectional relationship between firm economic variables and management preferences in the selection of an accounting technique for goodwill. It examines goodwill accounting policy disclosures in the 2000/2001 annual reports of 269 listed companies in the five countries: Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. The key focus is management’s choice of accounting techniques for the treatment of goodwill.The results show that accounting practices for goodwill vary significantly across country of origins and across industry groups. Two economic variables significantly explain management preferences of accounting for goodwill. The finding shows that the higher a company’s financial leverage ratio the company managers prefer to write off goodwill immediately against income or to capitalize and amortize it in a sorter period of time. The higher a company’s size, the more likely the company would write-off of goodwill to balance sheet reserves.

9,"Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is an instrumental institution used for specific purposes by firms. The SPV is useful for tax planning, risk management, project financing and company restructuring. SPVs have benefits for economy and business, and involve usually large size of projects that vary from about US$100 to US$500 million per project. However, SPVs have also some bad records. Huge business, finance, and accounting scandals involve the use of SPVs. The drawbacks of SPVs are due to lack of regulatory measures relating the application of SPVs, so that SPVs are used for hiding identities, debts and hiding non-productive assets. SPVs are used to deceive investors so that they can not judge the value and risks of the firms and investments correctly.The huge financial and accounting scandals such as Enron involved the use of SPVs for not reporting or undervaluing debt and overvaluing net worth.

Interestingly, most strategic alliances go through similar revolutionary cycles in terms of their motives and capabilities toward the cooperative relationship. Studies in this areas how that alliance failure is an outcome of the co-evolutionary adjustment to changes in the market, the competitive dynamics between partners, and assessment of efficiency of the alliance as an alternative governance structure. It is thus critical to adopt a dynamics perspective and historical observations of cooperative process.

9,"This paper examines whether the issuers of Indonesian manufacturing initial public offerings (IPOs) manage the firm's reported earnings by making income increasing discretionary accruals. The absence of market-determined prices for IPO shares prior to the offering has made issuers and underwriters to use nonprice information. The test was performed on a sample of 45 IPOs that went public during the period of July1991 through December 1994. The model used in this study follows the one developed by Friedlan (1994). The results show that there is no evidence that earnings management occurs among the sample firms. In other words, this study is unable to reject the null hypothesis that the issuers of Indonesian IPOs exercise accounting discretion that increases the reported earnings in the periods prior to the offering. In contrast, the study finds strong evidence of earnings management in the period after the offering, which could be interpreted as issuers trying to maintain the firm's performance after the offering by making income increasing discretionary accruals.",AN INVESTIGATION OF EARNINGS MANAGEMENT IN INDONESIAN MANUFACTURING INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS,2003-08-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,an investigation of earnings management in indonesian manufacturing initial public offerings this paper examines whether the issuers of indonesian manufacturing initial public offerings ipos manage the firms reported earnings by making income increasing discretionary accruals the absence of market determined prices for ipo shares prior to the offering has made issuers and underwriters to use nonprice information the test was performed on a sample of ipos that went public during the period of july through december the model used in this study follows the one developed by friedlan the results show that there is no evidence that earnings management occurs among the sample firms in other words this study is unable to reject the null hypothesis that the issuers of Indonesian ipos exercise accounting discretion that increases the reported earnings in the period prior to the offering in contrast the study finds strong evidence of earnings management in the period after the offering which could be interpreted as issuers trying to maintain the firm performance after the offering by making income increasing discretionary accruals,23387238,9
9,"Fierce competition in Indonesian banking industry had forced banks to get closer to their customers in order to maintain their customer base. However, considering the banks limited resources and the market competition, raised question on which customers they should focus to serve. Benefit segmentation as one of the concept of market segmentation, provides a clear picture of which segment or type of customers the bank should focus. Undertaken in a national bank, this research was aimed to identify benefits desired by the customer in financial service; segments for the bank based on those benefits; and to identify whether there is a relationship between customers' demographics and their desired benefits. Factor analysis with principal component method was used to extract 29 banking attributes to a set of factors that capable to capture the main features of the responses. Cluster analysis was then applied to the dataset to identify whether a bundle of benefit might be sought by a specific customer segment. The last, chi-square test was applied to identify whether there is any correlation between the cluster and the demographic variables. Five factors (main benefits) sought by the customers were found, namely:  safety-convenience; relational; bank's features; cost; and promotional incentives. Based on those factors, the customers could be classified into four segments, service-oriented (38.41%), rate sensitive (16.85%), incentive seekers (13.30%), and safety-convenience (31.44%). A significant correlation between demographic characteristics (gender, age, education, income, monthly spending, occupation, and number of children) and desired customer benefits were found.

9,"The purpose o f this study is to formally analyze product cost distortions resulting from the process of allocating costs to products based on Activity-Based Costing (ABC) and the conventional product costing systems. The model developed in this paper rigorously shows the impact of treating costs that are not volume related as if they are. The model demonstrates that the source of product cost distortion is the difference between the proportion of driver used by each product in ABC and the proportion of the base used by the same product in the conventional costing systems. The difference arises because the conventional costing systems ignore the existence of batch-related and product-related costs. The model predicts a positive association between volume and size diversity with product cost distortions. When interaction between volume and size diversity exists, the distortion is either mitigated or exacerbated. The magnitude of the distortion is jointly determined by the size of the differences and the size of the total indirect costs.",FORMALIZING PRODUCT COST DISTORTION: The Impact of Volume-Related Allocation Bases on Cost Information,2003-09-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,formalizing product cost distortions the impact of volume-related allocation bases on cost information the purpose of this study is to formally analyze product cost distortions resulting from the process of allocating costs to products based on activity-based costing abc and the conventional product costing systems the model developed in this paper rigorously shows the impact of treating costs that are not volume related as if they are the model demonstrating that the source of product cost distortion is the difference between the proportion of drivers used by each product in abc and the proportion of the base used by the same product in the conventional costing systems the difference arises because the conventional costing system ignores the existence of batch related and product related costs the model predicts a positive association between volume and size diversity with product cost distortions when interaction between volume and size diversity exists the distortion is either mitigated or exacerbated the magnitude of the distortion is jointly determined by the size of the differences and the size of the total indirect costs,23387238,9

Unlike listing studies in the developed markets, the announcements of the LQ45 Index changes have no impact on share price and trading volume. This may be due to the small role of Indonesian domestic institutional investors and purely rule-based characteristics of the LQ45 Index. On the contrary, the markets do respond to the changes in Indonesian stocks composition of the MSCI Equity Index.

9,"Criticisms directed at the use of financial measures alone for performance evaluation have led to much interest in the use of nonfinancial performance measures to balance the financial measures. Hence, much recent research has been directed to investigate the effectiveness sand behavioral consequences of a mix of financial and nonfinancial measures (e.g. the Balanced Scorecard approach) in contemporary settings. However, there is evidence from prior studies to suggest that the manner or how performance measures are used may affect the subordinates' behavior and work-related attitudes indirectly through the subordinates' perception of the justness of these measures and the interpersonal trust these measures promote. There is also evidence to indicate that it is the extent of the subordinates' agreement with the performance measures used in the evaluation, rather than the measures per se, which affects their behavior and work-related attitudes. Subordinates are more likely to agree with performance measures which they regard as fair and which enhance their trust in their superiors. This study therefore investigates if the effects of a mix of financial and nonfinancial measures (such as those used in the Balanced Scorecard approach) on subordinates' job satisfaction are indirect through the subordinates' perception of the greater extent of fairness (justness) in the evaluation process and the greater extent of trust such a mix of measures promotes. The results, based on a sample of 70 managers, support the expectation that a mix of financial and nonfinancial has no direct effect on subordinates’ job satisfaction. Instead, the effects of such a mix of performance measures on subordinates’ job satisfaction are indirect through the enhancement of the subordinates’ favorable perceptions of procedural fairness and interpersonal trust.",THE INTERVENING EFFECTS OF PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS AND INTERPERSONAL TRUST ON THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MULTIPLE MEASURES-BASED PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND MANAGERS' JOB SATISFACTION,2003-08-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the intervening effects of procedural fairness and interpersonal trust on the relationship between multiple measures-based performance evaluation and managers job satisfaction criticisms directed at the use of financial measures alone for performance evaluation have led to much interest in the use of nonfinancial performance measures to balance the financial measures hence much recent research has been directed to investigate the effectiveness and behavioral consequences of a mix of financial and nonfinancial measures e g the balanced scorecard approach in contemporary settings however there is evidence from previous studies to suggest that the manner or how performance measures are used may affect the subordinates behavior and work-related attitudes indirectly through the subordinates' perception of the fairness of these measures and the interpersonal trust these measures promote there is also evidence to indicate that it is the extent of the subordinates' agreement with the performance measures used in the evaluation rather than the measures per se which affects their behavior and work related attitudes subordinates are more likely to agree with performance measures which they regard as fair and which enhance their trust in their superiors this study therefore investigates if the effects of a mix of financial and nonfinancial measures such as those used in the balanced scorecard approach on subordinates job satisfaction is indirect through the subordinates' perception of the greater extent of fairness justness in the evaluation process and the greater extent of trust such as a mix of measures promotes the results based on a sample of managers supports the expectation that a mix of financial and nonfinancial has no direct effect on subordinates job satisfaction instead the effects of such a mix of performance measures on subordinates job satisfaction are indirect through the enhancement of the subordinates favorable perceptions of procedural fairness and interpersonal trust,23387238,9

9,"A great deal of attention has surrounded the role of embodied cognition in human judgments; however, it has received very little research attention, especially in the marketing field. This research is based on the idea that the act of cutting can activate perceptions of severing relationships, as well as eliciting a sense of independence. Study 1 showed that consumers are less likely to adopt a close friend’s opinion when they engage in the act of cutting an object with scissors. Study 2 demonstrated that people are less likely to trust the reviews of online communities while cutting a piece of string with scissors. These lowered intentions to adopt others’ opinions appeared to be mediated by increased psychological distances between the self and the information provider. In other words, people who engage in the act of scissoring unconsciously weaken or disconnect themselves from the information providers, thereby choosing not to adopt others’ opinions.

9,"Complaints delivered directly to a firm will not be a problem if they can be handled properly, while the ones that are not disclosed directly to the firm but to a third party or even warnings to others not to use particular products or services, will be negative word-of-mouth communication. It can damage the image of the firm and be very detrimental. The purpose of this study was to analyze the antecedents of intention to engage in negative online word-of-mouth communication that includes dissatisfaction, service importance, success of complaint, complaint benefit, self confidence, altruism, retaliatory intention, and complaint cost. Medical services were selected considering the impact caused by the negligence of the service provider possibly giving rise to negative word-of-mouth communication. The online environment has been considered because of the developments in technology which provide opportunities for consumers to communicate with ach other. In addition, the dissemination of information through online media can spread incredibly widely and rapidly. The samples in this study comprised consumers of medical services who had disappointing experiences in using those services either directly or indirectly. A total of 123 questionnaires were analyzed with multiple regression analysis to test the research hypothesis.

9,"This study examines the characteristics of board structure that affect Chinese public firm’s financial performance. Using a sample of 871 firms with 699 observations of previously private firms and 1,914 observations of previously state-owned enterprise (SOE) firms, we investigate the differences in corporate governance between publicly listed firms that used to be pure private firms before going public and listed firms that used to be SOEs before their initial public offerings (IPOs). Our main finding is that previously private firms outperform previously SOE firms in China after IPOs. In the wake of becoming listed firms, previously SOE firms might be faced with difficulties adjusting to professional business practices to build and extend competitive advantages. In addition, favorable policies and assistance from the government to the SOE firms might have triggered complacency, especially in early years after getting listed. On the other hand, professional savvy and acumen, combined with efficiency and favorable business climate created by the government have probably led the previously private firms to improve their values stronger and faster.",Do Private Firms Outperform SOE Firms after Going Public in China Given their Different Governance Characteristics?,2013-06-12,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,do private firms outperform soe firms after going public in china given their different governance characteristics this study examines the characteristics of board structure that affect chinese public firms financial performance using a sample of firms with observations of previously private firms and observations of previously stateowned enterprise soe firms we investigated the differences in corporate governance between publicly listed firms that used to be pure private firms before going public and listed firms that used to be soes before their initial public offerings ipos our main finding is that previously private firms outperformed previously soe firms in china after ipos in the wake of becoming listed firms previously soe firms might be faced with difficulties adjusting to professional business practices to build and extend competitive advantages in addition favorable and policies from the government to the soe firms might have triggered complacency especially in early years after getting listed on the other hand professional savvy and acumen combined with efficiency and favorable business climate created by the government have probably led the previously private firms to improve their values ​​stronger and faster,23387238,9

9,"The aim of this paper is to investigate efficiency performance of Malaysian banking market using data envelopment analysis approach in the context of the increasing presence of foreign banks. Specifically, two measures of efficiency are constructed, cost and profit efficiency by utilizing bank-level data of Malaysian commercial banks, over the period 2003 to 2014. The results obtained show the domestic banks are more efficient than the foreign banks counterparts for both measures of efficiency. Next, the Lerner Index approach is employed to measure competition and finally, Granger causality tests are undertaken to answer the question, does competition foster efficiency? The results of causality tests support a positive effect of competition on cost and profit efficiency of Malaysian banks.

The analysis used panel data regressions and the Wald test over the period from 2001-2008. The results showed a positive or complementary association between derivatives and discretionary accruals. The positive association implied that managers tended to intensify the use of discretionary accruals to offset a higher use of derivatives.

9,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of credit, liquidity and operational risks in six Indonesian’s islamic banking financing products namely mudharabah, musyarakah, murabahah, istishna, ijarah and qardh, in order to try to discover whether or not Indonesian islamic banking is based on the “risk-sharing” system. This paper relies on a fixed effect model test based on the panel data analysis method, focusing on the period from 2007 to 2013. The research is an exploratory and descriptive study of all the Indonesian islamic banks that were operating in 2013. The results of this study show that the Islamic banking system in Indonesia truly has banking products based on “risk-sharing.” We found out that credit, operational and liquidity risks as a whole, have significant influence on mudarabah, musyarakah, murabahah, istishna, ijarah and qardh based financing. There is a correlation between the credit risk and mudarabah based financing, and no causal relationship between the credit risk and musharaka, murabahah, ijarah, istishna and qardh based financing. There is also correlation between the operational risk and mudarabah and murabahah based financing, and no causal relationship between the operational risk and musharaka, istishna, ijarah and qardh based financing. There is correlation between the liquidity risk and istishna based financing, and no causal relationship between the liquidity risk and musharaka, mudarabah, murabahah, ijarah and qardh based financing. A major implication of this study is the fact that there is no causal relationship between the credit risk and musharakah based financing, which is the mode of financing where the islamic bank shares the risk with its clients, but there is an influence of credit risk toward mudarabah mode financing, a financing mode where the Islamic bank bears all the risk. These findings can lead us to conclude that the Indonesian Islamic banking sector is based on the “risk sharing” system.","Analysis of The Influence of Liquidity, Credit and Operational Risk, in Indonesian Islamic Bank’s Financing for The Period 2007-2013",2015-12-18,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,analysis of the influence of credit liquidity and operational risks in Indonesian Islamic banking financing for the period the purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of credit liquidity and operational risks in six Indonesian Islamic banking financing products namely mudharabah musyarakah murabahah istishna ijarah and qardh in order to try to discover whether or not Indonesian Islamic banking is based on the risksharing system this paper relies on a fixed effect model test based on the panel data analysis method focusing on the period from to the research is an exploratory and descriptive study of all the Indonesian Islamic banks that were operating in the results of this study show that the Islamic banking system in Indonesia truly has banking products based on risk sharing we found out that credit operational and liquidity risks as a whole have significant influence on mudarabah musyarakah murabahah istishna ijarah and qardh based financing there is a correlation between the credit risk and mudarabah based financing and no causal relationship between the credit risk and musharaka murabahah ijarah istishna and qardh based financing there is also a correlation between the operational risk and mudarabah and murabahah based financing and no causal relationship between the operational risk and musharaka istishna ijarah and qardh based financing there is a correlation between the liquidity risk and istishna based financing and no causal relationship between the liquidity risk and musharaka mudarabah murabahah ijarah and qardh based financing a major implication of this study is the fact that there is no causal relationship between the credit risk and musharakah based financing which is the mode of financing where the Islamic bank shares the risk with its clients but there is an influence of credit risk toward mudarabah financing mode a financing mode where the Islamic bank bears all the risk these findings can lead us to conclude that the Indonesian Islamic banking sector is based on the risk sharing system,23387238,9

However, SME managers first need to understand the consequences of the two unique emotional and rational components of trust on attitudinal and behavioral loyalty, because both loyalty dimensions have unique consequences for a brand’s performance. Hence, this study aims to answer two research issues: (1) Do brand intentions and brand reliability influence both attitudinal loyalty and behavioral loyalty? (2) Which component of trust explains attitudinal and behavioral loyalty more? Data were obtained from 210 customers through the use of an intercept survey method on successful SME brands in the restaurant industry.

A cross sectional survey was employed which yielded 535 responses. Structural equation modelling using the AMOS version 2.0 was utilized to test study the hypotheses. Test results reveal that service satisfaction, service switching costs and service quality are the three antecedents that directly influence service loyalty. However, consumer innovativeness does not have any direct effect on service loyalty. Moreover, service satisfaction is found to be a partial mediator between ‘service quality’ and ‘service loyalty’. Findings from this study will develop insights to enable policy-makers, managers and marketers to better strategize and effectively implement loyalty programs and prevent their customers from switching.

In contrast to other studies, this research was built under a retroductive approach by using a time series quasi experimental study. Investors were directly assessed for their irrationality by using an adapted psychometric test on 4 occasions. The results indicate that there were indeed effects of the full moon and high temperatures on investors’ irrationality. Because the full moon and high temperatures frequently occurred on Mondays, it is most probably those two variables that were the drivers of the Monday irrationality.

9,"In a developing economy, the acceptability of e–retailing is not very new, but the potential of online marketing in market research and analysis is still largely unexplored. This article is an attempt to understand the psyche of Indian online consumers. As consumers have their own preconceived notions toward this growing purchasing environment, it becomes important for e-retailers to understand the consumers’ perceptions and attitudes toward online purchases. This paper integrates the dimensions of the risks and benefits with the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to understand how consumers adopt their online purchase processes. Four hundred and sixty-eight valid responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling on AMOS 21 to identify the relationship between the different factors and the intention to purchase online. The paper concludes that consumers’ purchase intentions are jointly determined by their attitude towards online purchases and the subjective norm. Furthermore, their attitude is determined by the sub-dimensions of perceived benefits (hedonic benefit, convenience benefit, economic benefit and variety) and the sub-dimensions of perceived risk (product risk and financial risk).",Comparing Risks and Benefits for Value Enhancement of Online Purchase,2017-12-22,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,comparing risks and benefits for value enhancement of online purchases in a developing economy the acceptability of retailing is not very new but the potential of online marketing in market research and analysis is still largely unexplored this article is an attempt to understand the psyche of indian online consumers as consumers have their own preconceived notions toward this growing purchasing environment it becomes important for retailers to understand the consumers' perceptions and attitudes toward online purchases this paper integrates the dimensions of the risks and benefits with the theory of planned behavior tpb to understand how consumers adopt their online purchase processes four hundred and sixtyeight valid responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling on amos to identify the relationship between the different factors and the intention to purchase online the paper concludes that consumers purchase intentions are jointly determined by their attitude towards online purchases and the subjective norm furthermore their attitude is determined by the subdimensions of perceived benefits hedonic benefit convenience benefit economic benefit and variety and the subdimensions of perceived risk product risk and financial risk,23387238,9

Based on the contingency theory, this paper examines the moderating effect of interfirm collaboration on the relationship between Human Resource Management (HRM) practices and organizational performance. Interfirm collaboration refers to the collaboration strategies undertaken by R&D companies, with other companies in similar or diverse functional areas, including R&D, marketing, or manufacturing, to enhance performance.  Using data from 64 R&D companies, the hierarchical regression analyses showed that only collaboration in R&D and functional collaboration in manufacturing significantly moderated the relationship between HRM practices and organizational performance. Overall, the results provided partial support in the domain of the contingency theory.

This paper attempts to reveal the determinants of tax evasion from the institutional perspectives. The objective of this study is to identify the determinants of tax evasion a decade after the introduction of a Self-Assessment System (SAS). Three institutional perspectives of the determinants of tax evasion were examined, namely the probability of being detected, the role of the tax authority and the complexity of the tax system. The results suggested that the complexity of the system, and the probability of being detected had a significant impact on tax evasion. The results of this study could possibly contribute to the body of knowledge in lieu of combating tax evasion, as well as being an input to tax administrators and policymakers into which ways the determinants can affect compliance. The findings also provide an indicator for tax administrators of the relative importance of the tax system in assisting with the design of tax education programs, simplifying tax systems and developing a wider understanding of taxpayers’ behavior.","Issues, Challenges and Problems with Tax Evasion: The Institutional Factors Approach",2016-08-10,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,issues challenges and problems with tax evasion the institutional factors approach tax evasion particularly in developing countries is a debatable issue evasion is a disease and needs to be minimized so that the black economy or hidden economy can be mitigated this paper attempts to reveal the determinants of tax evasion from the institutional perspectives the objective of this study is to identify the determinants of tax evasion a decade after the introduction of a self-assessment system sas three institutional perspectives of the determinants of tax evasion were examined namely the probability of being detected the role of the tax authority and the complexity of the tax system the results suggested that the complexity of the system and the probability of being detected had a significant impact on tax evasion the results of this study could possibly contribute to the body of knowledge in lieu of combating tax evasion as well as being an input to tax administrators and policymakers into which ways the determinants can affect compliance the findings also provide an indicator for tax administrators of the relative importance of the tax system in assisting with the design of tax education programs simplifying tax systems and developing a wider understanding of taxpayers behavior,23387238,9

The paper is based on in-depth semi-structured interviews and a review of the relevant documents. Eighteen interviews with twelve Muslim scholars, two ulamas (mufti), two organisational donors, and two relevant government officers, both in Indonesia and in Malaysia were, respectively, conducted. The Muslim scholars interviewed perceived that accounting and accountability activities are not contradictory to Islamic teachings. The accountability relationship in Islam is  viewed as not only fulfilling the legal requirements, but also fulfilling the relationship with God. The findings clearly indicate that a formal accountability mechanism is strongly encouraged in Islam, and financial reporting is viewed as essential in enhancing the accountability of Islamic religious organizations. Therefore, any organization dealing with community funds must demonstrate its financial accountability formally; i.e., through written reports.

Research data were taken from the US, Brazil, Russia, India, China and Indonesia from 2007 to 2013.   This research found that the TDP is important for enhancing firm performance. Also, the role of the training and development policy impacted each firm’s performance differently, according to the level of corporate governance of that firm. The moderating effect of corporate governance reveals that better governance of a firm may have an influence on its TDP policy, which would lead to better firm performance. Overall, the results are consistent with the conjecture that corporate governance influences the firm’s performance and training and development policy, suggesting that the training and development policy’s success depends on the corporate governance level of the firm.

Stock return synchronicity represents the degree to which market and industry information explains firm-level stock return variations. A higher stock return synchronicity indicates the higher quality of a firm’s information environment, because a firm’s stock price reflects more market-level and industry-level information relative to firm-specific information. Our study shows that stock return synchronicity positively affects the forecast properties.

In 1998, the Indonesian government initiated the IEPSA to privatize its State-Owned Enterprises (SOE). Problems arose due to the lack of stakeholders’ support, although it was able to improve the performance of the SOE. Variables within the stakeholders’ support and the relationship among stakeholders were the keys to bring the IEPSA into prevalence; they comprised of its transparency, share price, the degree of the internal relationship, fulfilment of the budget deficit, company restructuring, unprecedented moment, restricted shares in the market, the existence of the floor price, and the plan for the IEPSA.

A mail survey is used to deliver a questionnaire to 151 auditors from ten CPA firm in Indonesia. The result shows that emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction fully mediates the relationship of work-family conflict with job performance. The result also demonstrates that Work-Interfering-Family (WIF) has significant effects on emotional exhaustion and job satisfaction, but Family-Interfering-Work (FIW) has no significant influence on either emotional exhaustion or job satisfaction.

However, no empirical evidence on the combined role of both workplace fairness and information sharing on employee performance has been found so far. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of workplace fairness and information sharing on employees’ performance in a budget setting. A set of direct and indirect hypotheses are tested using survey data collected from 108 sub-unit managers from various industries, randomly selected from Bursa Malaysia (the stock exchange of Malaysia). The findings indicate that both workplace fairness and information sharing are positively associated with improved employee performance in a participative budget setting.

The results of this study reveal, firstly, both equity-based compensation and debt-like compensation induce risk-taking behavior by the executives. Secondly, the correlation between both the form of the compensation and the CDS spread is weakened in a high information asymmetry environment. Lastly, this study finds that a CFO’s compensation has more influence on the CDS spread, compared to the other board executives, but this condition only occurs when the compensation is awarded in the form of debt-like compensation.

9,"The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. FDI has been identified as an economic consequence of IFRS. However, thus far, few studies have examined this issue in developing countries and there are no studies which have examined IFRS-FDI in ASEAN countries. In order to fulfill this objective, this study hypothesizes that IFRS is positively associated with FDI inflows. The hypothesis was empirically tested using a sample consisting of the ten ASEAN countries from 2001 to 2016, using a bias corrected Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDVC), and Ordinary Least Square (OLS). The results of the LSDVC and OLS analyses indicate that IFRS is positively associated with FDI inflows. Normally after the adoption of a new standard such as IFRS, regulators, practitioners and academicians would be interested in understanding the consequences. Therefore, this study contributes to the understanding of the economic consequences of IFRS. This study also provides evidence regarding the outcomes of IFRS, from the aspects of FDI inflows’ enhancement. Therefore, the outcomes of this study may be useful for adopter and non-adopter countries to understand the economic consequences of IFRS.

The results of this study indicate that the measurement model of innovation consists of technological innovation and the management of technological innovation. There are three phases in the technological innovation process which include the initiation phase (conceiving ideas and acquiring information, then transforming it into knowledge), the development phase (validating knowledge and checking its appropriateness), and the diffusion phase (getting users' feedback and Go & scaling up). Meanwhile, the management of technological innovation consists of having a strategy, the necessary resources, and operation. The analytical generalization of this study is still considered to be limited, so further studies are needed to analyze cases in other industrial sectors. In addition, a quantitative study is required to construct a measuring instrument for the variables proposed in this study.",A Technological Innovativeness Measurement Framework: A Case Study of Technology Based Indonesian Companies,2021-04-29,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,a technological innovativeness measurement framework a case study of technology based Indonesian companies the measurement of innovation has been developed by various previous studies with a specific focus and goal however the existing measurement framework still cannot be applied all that easily by companies in Indonesia for assessing evaluating and improving their innovations this study aims to propose a measurement framework using a multiple case study approach cases were selected from companies in the pharmaceutical and information and communications technology ICT industries because they contribute substantially to the manufacturing sector and both are vital to Indonesia the results of this study indicates that the measurement model of innovation consists of technological innovation and the management of technological innovation there are three phases in the technological innovation process which include the initiation phase conceiving ideas and acquiring information then transforming it into knowledge the development phase validating knowledge and checking its appropriateness and the diffusion phase getting users feedback and go scaling up meanwhile the management of technological innovation consists of having a strategy the necessary resources and operation the analytical generalization of this study is still considered to be limited so further studies are needed to analyze cases in other industrial sectors in addition to a quantitative study is required to construct a measuring instrument for the variables proposed in this study,23387238,9

Based on Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior, the capacity theory, and the need for achievement theory, an extension model on the entrepreneurial intentions involving implementing mindset and elaborating mindset has been proposed. These constructs were confirmed in the proposed research model, including the need for achievement, perceived educational support, perceived structural support, perceived relational support and entrepreneurial intentions. The moderating role of gender, Grade Point Average (GPA) and the type of university were also tested. Research findings support that the need for achievement has a significant impact on the students’ mindsets and their entrepreneurial intentions.

9,"The main objective of the study is to identify what Malaysian IPO issuers indicate as intended use of IPO proceeds and the use that has the highest amount of allocation. In order to achieve the objective of the study, a manual content analysis of 221 IPO prospectuses issued during the period of 2005-2015 were considered. Based on the manual content analysis, the data were analysed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results indicate that the three major intended uses of IPO proceeds in Malaysian IPO market are growth opportunities (53.90%), debt repayment (29.12%) and working capital (12.87%). However, growth opportunities and debt repayment have greater amount of allocation than working capital over the sample periods. Additionally results show that Malaysian IPO issuers expend more on capital expenditure and expansion rather than research and development in terms of growth opportunities. Further analysis in terms of the frequencies of number of IPO issuers indicate that number of issuers that have a designated amount for working capital (95%) supersede issuers in the growth opportunities group (90%). These results suggest that issuers can consider intended use of IPO proceeds information as a signal mechanism and potential investors can as well consider the information useful before making their investment decisions.",Decomposition of intended use of IPO proceeds: Evidence from Malaysia,2021-04-18,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,decomposition of intended use of ipo proceeds evidence from malaysia the main objective of the study is to identify what malaysian ipo issuers indicate as intended use of ipo proceeds and the use that has the highest amount of allocation in order to achieve the objective of the study a manual content analysis of ipo prospects issued during the period of were considered based on the manual content analysis the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance anova the results indicated that the three major intended uses of ipo proceeds in malaysian ipo market are growth opportunities debt repayment and working capital however growth opportunities and debt repayment have greater amount of allocation than working capital over the sample periods additionally results show that malaysian ipo issuers spend more on capital expenditure and expansion rather than research and development in terms of growth opportunities further analysis in terms of the frequency of number of ipo issuers indicates that number of issuers that have a designated amount for working capital supersede issuers in the growth opportunities group these results suggest that issuers can consider intended use of ipo success information as a signal mechanism and potential investors can as well consider the useful information before making their investment decisions,23387238,9

9,"This study investigates the multiple exchange rate exposure of large non-financial firms in Asia and emerging countries using the unadjusted and adjusted two-factor exchange rate exposure model. The autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) method was applied to investigate the existence of exchange rate exposure. The Dimson-Fowler-Rorke (DFR) adjustment method was applied to adjust the ordinary least squares (OLS) market risk estimator for the thin trading phenomenon. The study’s findings indicate that exchange rate exposure does affect firm value. Incorporating the DFR market beta in the exchange rate exposure model indicates two important findings. Firstly, there is a significant increase in the number of firms exposed to exchange rate movements, especially in Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. Secondly, there are more firms that will be exposed to multi bilateral exchange rate exposure across the sample countries. The findings imply that market characteristics such as thin trading could be an alternative explanation of the exchange rate exposure puzzle.

9,"From practical point of view, Price-Earnings (P/E) ratio is one of numerous important aspects to consider. Analysts, investors, and traders in stock markets use P/E ratio –together with other information- in analyzing the past performance, and predicting the future prospect of securities in the market. However, noting its importance, there are some significant disagreements among researchers regarding the ability of P/E ratio in providing “correct information” about the future return of company stocks. One of the topics under discussion is about the presence of so-called low P/E effect, which hypothesizes that high P/E will be followed by low returns and low P/E will be followed by high returns. This study, by repeating partially Johnson et al. (1989) procedures, was trying to confirm the low P/E effect hypothesis in Indonesian market. The study involved 267 stocks listed in Jakarta Stock Exchange in the sample frame and selected the period of 1994-2000 as the focus of analysis. The study also has an intention to investigate whether there was a structural change in return-P/E relationship from the pre-crisis period (1994-1996) to the crisis period (1998-2000). The procedure of analysis was divided into two sections. In the first section a descriptive macro (market) analysis was presented, to test the hypothesis at the market level. It started with an overview about the fluctuation and trend of market P/E ratios during the period of 1991-2000, and followed by investigating the relationship between market P/E and the following returns. A regression analysis was also performed to strengthen the analysis from statistical point of view. In the second section, analysis is more directed to the portfolio level where the portfolios were ranked according to their P/E ratios.

9,"Recently, stock valuation model using the earning multiplier approach (PER) is more popular among investors and analysts. This popularity has caused this model to seem to be the most perfect model among other valuation models. In response to the fact above, this research tries togive empirical evidence whether PER’s cross-sectional model can be used in determining the fairness of stock price traded in Jakarta Stock Exchange.Evaluation of the capability of PER’s cross-sectional model in determining the common stock price was conducted by developing three regression models from different time periods, namely the years of 1995, 1996, and 1997. The regression models used in this research was the one developed by Whitbeck-Kisor (1973). The model employed growth, dividend payout ratio (DPR), and standard deviation of growth (s-growth) as independent variable.This research was intended to test the consistency of the model in assessing stock prices. The result of this research showed that each model developed at different time periods, though with the same sample and method, gave different results. The differences were in the significance level and in the weight of influence of independent variables to the corresponding dependent variables.

There were two events to be investigated in this study, first (1) The banking reforms announcement on March 13, 1999 which consists of the closure of 38 private banks, the taken-over of 7 private banks, 9 private banks will be recapitalized, and let 73 private banks to continue their operation without joining the recapitalization program; second (2) on May 28, 1999 Minister of Finance issued government bonds amounted to Rp 103,831 trillion to complete the private banks’ recapitalization, and also issued the other government bonds to repay the obligations of frozen commercial banks’ and rural banks’ regarding its liquidity support, to Bank Indonesia amounted to Rp 53,779 trillion.These two events above, are expected to be good news or favorable information for investors on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX), and should be responded positively by investors which indicates significantly increases on banking stocks after the event dates.Thirteen samples of banking stocks which were listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) at the beginning of 1997 were used to investigate the reaction of banking stocks around the dates of these two events. By using the paired-samples mean difference test, we did not find significant differences between abnormal returns before and after the event dates. Furthermore, the cumulative abnormal return of banking stocks around the banking reforms announcement on March 13, 1999 and the issuance of government bonds announcement on May 28, 1999 were decreasing gradually until it reached the negative area.

9,"This study evaluated the value-relevance of accounting information (earnings and cash flows) in Indonesia to predict a firm’s future operating cash flows. The predictive usefulness of earnings and cash flows in association with future cash flows is of interest for three reasons. They include providing empirical evidence on the relevant accounting information to assess a firm’s future cash flows, information about the behavior and properties of Indonesian accounting information, and evidence of – or at least providing a basis for evaluating–the validity of the IndonesianAccounting Standards Committee (KPSAK) assertion on the usefulness of accounting information to assess future cash flows.The study evaluated three cash flow prediction models that employed cash flow, earnings, and a combination of earnings-cash flow variables. The models were applied on a firm-specific data set. The data used in this study were semi-annual data for the 61 sample firms (manufacturing firms)listed in the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) spanning the years 1990-1997. The results of this study supported the proposed hypothesis that cash flow data provided better information to assess a firm’s future cash flows than earnings data. Since this study employed manufacturing firms only, future research is necessary to evaluate the robustness of the results to otherpopulations of firms and/or by using an alternative deflator of earnings and cash flows, such as consumer price index (CPI) or market value of the firms.

9,"The implementation of a deposit insurance scheme entails a trade off. On one hand, as shown in theoretical and empirical studies, a deposit insurance scheme reduces the likelihood of a bank run. On the other hand, a deposit insurance scheme induces moral hazard among bankers that may lead to bank failures. We rigorously test the effect of different deposit coverage limit and the implementation of a differential premium treatment on bankers’ behaviors in the deposit and credit market. We do so by designing a laboratory experiment that involves real bankers as participants. We find that the coverage limit treatments do not have any effect on deposit rate offer. Nevertheless, we find that a high deposit coverage limit induces smaller banks to have a higher share of risky projects. This is evidence of moral hazard particularly among small banks.",Does a Deposit Insurance Scheme Induce Moral Hazard among Bankers?

The role of self-efficacy, as an important variable that mediates the relationship between the predictor and the criterion variable, is significantly evaluated. A non-probability sampling technique was used to collect 245 questionnaires from frontline employees of five and four-star hotels in Nigeria. The findings reveal that supervisor incivility has a negative effect on self-efficacy and a positive effect on cynicism, and that self-efficacy negatively affects cynicism. There was no significant relationship with job embeddedness in the study.  Importantly, the investigation establishes that self-efficacy is a mediating variable between supervisor incivility and cynicism.

First, this study highlights that multinational firms tend to avoid taxes higher than national ones. Second, it induces the dividend catering theory related to the country’s investor protection. The latest, it persuades that country’s investor protection, and law systems make firms contingent on their tax avoidance behaviors. This study finds that firms where they live in high investors’ protection countries and common law did higher tax avoidance than others.

9,"There are countless studies about the influence of other people’s emotions on individuals' behavior. However, the influence of proponents' and opponents' future emotions on achievement motivation remains unclear. This study aims to fill this gap. Therefore, departing from the emotional intelligence theory, the author materializes the anticipated emotions of other people concept and tests it using a static group experimental design with success and failure scenarios, involving 203 participants chosen judgmentally. When reminded of the proponents' joyfulness caused by their success, the Mann-Whitney U test with normal approximation, supported by the Monte Carlo estimation, shows that the mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals of the experimental group are enhanced. Whereas, when reminded that they would be envied and make the opponents feel distressed, the performance-approach goals are improved. In the failure scenario, when the participants were directed to the proponents' distress, as a response to their failure, the four components of the achievement goals are increased: mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance. However, the opponents' joyfulness, anticipated as a malicious schadenfreude to the participants' failure, is only successful in stimulating the performance-avoidance goals.  A Bayesian estimate with 5,000 times bootstrapping reveals that self-efficacy mediates the influence of the proponents' anticipated joyfulness on the mastery-approach fully, and on the performance-approach goals in a complementary way. Complementary mediation is also apparent in the impact of the proponents' distress on the mastery-approach and mastery-avoidance goals. Above all, love for the proponents is more potent than hatred from social environments for increasing the achievement motivation. Further research is encouraged to replicate this study with different social behavior.",How Proponents and Opponents Influence Achievement Motivation: The Role of the Anticipated Emotions of Other People,2021-02-04,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,how proponents and opponents influence achievement motivation the role of the anticipated emotions of other people there are countless studies about the influence of other people's emotions on individual behavior however the influence of proponents and opponents future emotions on achievement motivation remains unclear this study aims to fill this gap therefore departing from the emotional intelligence theory the author materializes the anticipated emotions of other people concept and tests it using a static group experimental design with success and failure scenarios involving participants chosen judgmentally when reminded of the proponents joyfulness caused by their success the mannwhitney u test with normal approximation supported by the monte carlo estimation shows that the mastery avoidance performance approach and performance avoidance goals of the experimental group were enhanced whereas when reminded that they would be envied and make the opponents feel distressed the performance approach goals were improved in the failure scenario when the participants were directed to the proponents distress as a response to their failure the four components of the achievement goals are increased masteryapproach masteryavoidance performanceapproach and performanceavoidance however the opponents joyfulness anticipated as a malicious schadenfreude to the participants failure is only successful in stimulating the performance avoidance goals a bayesian estimate with times bootstrapping reveals that self efficacy mediates the influence of the proponents anticipated joyfulness on the mastery approach fully and on the performance approach goals in a complementary way complementary mediation is also apparent in the impact of the proponents distress on the masteryapproach and masteryavoidance goals above all love for the proponents is more potent than hatred from social environments for increasing the achievement motivation further research is encouraged to replicate this study with different social behavior,23387238,9
9,"Experiencing strong personal development and growth are important for engineers, compared to professionals in other fields. Nevertheless, if career goal development behaviour is not present in sufficient quantities, engineers would be at risk if their own goals and expectations are not aligned with the companies they are working for. As a result, it may have a negative impact on their well-being. In this article, a sample of professional engineers (N=387) were utilised to examine the relationship between protean career orientation towards career goal development, career satisfaction and psychological well-being and to examine the mediating effect of career goal development between protean career orientation toward career satisfaction and psychological well-being. The research model was tested using the goal setting theory. The results of a partial least square (PLS) regression demonstrated that protean career orientation had a positive effect towards career goal development; subsequently career goal development had a positive effect on career satisfaction and psychological well-being. On the other hand, career goal development was found not to mediate the relationship between protean career orientation towards career satisfaction and psychological well-being. Based on the findings, this research suggests employers and industries encourage their unlicensed engineers to register as graduate engineers, so that later they can upgrade themselves to professional engineers’ status, as eventually this would help them to experience their job in a more meaningful way, and consequently increase their work happiness.","The Interaction Between Protean Career Orientation, Career Goal Development and Well-being Outcomes: Evidence from  Professional Engineers",2020-05-21,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the interaction between protean career orientation career goal development and wellbeing outcomes evidence from professional engineers experiencing strong personal development and growth are important for engineers compared to professionals in other fields however if career goal development behavior is not present in sufficient quantities engineers would be at risk if their own goals and expectations are not aligned with the companies they are working for as a result it may have a negative impact on their wellbeing in this article a sample of professional engineers n were utilized to examine the relationship between protean career orientation towards career goal development career satisfaction and psychological well-being and to examine the mediating effect of career goal development between protean career orientation toward career satisfaction and psychological well-being the research model was tested using the goal setting theory the results of a partial least squares regression demonstrated that protean career orientation had a positive effect towards career goal development after career goal development had a positive effect on career satisfaction and psychological wellbeing on the other hand career goal development was found not to mediate the relationship between protean career orientation towards career satisfaction and psychological wellbeing based on the findings this research suggests employers and industries encourage their unlicensed engineers to register as graduate engineers so that later they can upgrade themselves to professional engineers status as eventually this would help them to experience their job in a more meaningful way and consequently increase their work happiness,23387238,9

9,"The current service trend does not merely involve face-to-face interactions, including smiling (high-contact-service) by service employees, but also using methods such as texting (low-contact service). Sincere and insincere smile studies have used a method involving dynamic (videos) and static stimuli (photographs). However, research into the different types of smiles is still limited to methods using a vignette. This study aims to examine the effect of the type of smile on customer satisfaction using a vignette and video. A total of 139 people participated in 2 (smile: sincere versus insincere) x 2 (media: vignette versus video) groups. The study found that there is an influence from the type of smile on customer satisfaction. A sincere smile using video produces greater customer satisfaction than using a vignette does, because the emotional contagion process through video is more real than it is through a vignette. The interesting finding from this study is that there is a gap in the insincere smile condition between using video and a vignette. The dissatisfaction of customers is greater when served with an insincere smile by text (vignette), compared with a face-to-face interaction by video. Video could only capture the muscle movement on a person’s cheeks (zygomaticus major), but it could not see the muscle wrinkles formed around the eyes (orbicularis oculi), compared to a vignette. This study implies that although the standard operational procedure (SOP) for service demands friendliness, a customer can feel whether a server’s smile is genuine or fake.

9,"A trailer is a brief description of a film and provides a 1 to 3 minute cinematic experience that displays images from the film to influence consumer behavior. This research was conducted to propose a conceptual model regarding affective, cognitive, and environmental responses to viral marketing, which are moderated by audience behavior, for the movie trailer of “Spiderman: Far from Home.” The film was released in July 2019 by Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This study adopted the wheel of consumer analysis to bridge the research gap. An online survey was forwarded to 200 respondents using structured questionnaires through social media sites, such as Line, WhatsApp, Facebook, and e-mail. The data were then analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that the audience’s affective, cognitive, and environmental responses significantly influenced viral marketing. The results further indicated that the audience’s behavior was not a moderating variable, as the significance level was less than 0.05. The results can contribute to determining social media marketing strategies for promoting film trailers that are beneficial for companies, especially in Indonesia. Therefore, the companies can grow and become more competitive in the film industry.

The imagination scale contains four types of imagination, that is, benefit-anticipatory imagination, emotional-bonding imagina­tion, symbolic imagination, and mind-wandering imagination.In this paper, the pro­po­sed constructs of the imagination types are related to other relevant constructs exis­ting in marketing literature.The purpose of this research is twofold. First, it establishes the nomological validity of the imagination measures by placing it in the context of hedonic-utilitarian concepts proposed by Holbrook and Hirschman (1983). Second, the research empirically studies the effect of situational factor, that is concrete versus abstract advertisement execution, on imagination elicitation. The study is an experiment which employs mixed factor design involving eight sub-groups of participants. Results of the research demons­trate the nomological validity of the imagination scale where the four types of imagination were elicited in response to hedonic/utilitarian product depicted in the ad and situational factors (that is, abstract versus concrete ads).",Assessing the Imagination Scale’s Nomological Validity: Effect of Hedonic versus Utilitarian Product Types and Abstract versus Concrete Advertising Execution,2020-08-30,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,versus concrete ads,23387238,9

This research validates an instrument thatevaluates the employability factors of millennials in Mexico, according to their own expectations. We based our study on the previous literature about the millennial generation in many countries. To validate the questionnaire, a sampling of 781 workers from the states of Querétaro and Guanajuato in México was conducted. The method used to achieve the objective was through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling, and tested two different methods: first order and second order models. With the three methods, exploratory, first order and second order factor analyses, similar results were obtained. In the analysis of the statistical techniques, two latent variables associated with the expectations of this generational group were generated. The factors found are “personal satisfaction with the organization” and “satisfaction with the organization’s social commitment.” These two factors are supported by the literature of other researchers.

9,"This study investigates whether the Indonesian regulators control Indonesian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with matching or mismatching empowerment strategies, in light of their strengths and current standing. Indonesian SMEs contributed approximately 60.34% to Indonesia’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. In addition, Indonesian regulators have focused on financial support through credit policies and tax incentives. Indonesian SMEs have been standing on organizational readiness and readiness for change, based on their social networks and social cognition. It collected thirteen informants with different expertise and experiences. This study’s results suggest Indonesia’s regulatory body and financial institutions should consider the SMEs’ social cognition and organizational readiness for change. According to the current situation, to empower Indonesian SMEs, we recommend strategies such as achieving knowledge supremacy, creating an economic development board, as in Singapore, formulating comprehensive industry-wide policies, adopting omnibus laws, and implementing a shifting balance strategy. In other words, the Indonesian regulators should implement major reforms, which are similar to glasnost and perestroika in the former Soviet Union. This is to enhance Indonesian SMEs and achieve the goal of the Government of Indonesia (GoI) with respect to the optimal distinctiveness of Indonesia’s future economy.

9,"The purpose of this paper is to test the relationship of CSR practice­–asymmetry information and ESG performance–asymmetry information. We conjecture that there might be a particular role where the disclosure of non-financial information is deemed useful in truncating the level of asymmetry information. Using the data from two different countries, Indonesia (Asia) and Portugal (Europe), we extracted 37 companies with time period of observation ranges from 2012 to 2016. To manifest the empirical test, we use CSR report (CSR_Rep), CSR committee (CSR_com), CSR assurance (CSR_ass) and GRI adoption as the proxies of CSR practice, while the proxies of ESG performance are represented by Environmental (ENVscr), Social (SOCscr), and Governance (GOVscr) pillar scores as obtained from Thomson Reuters ASSET4 database. Bid-ask spread is used as the surrogate indicator of asymmetry information. The empirical test reveals that only variable GRI and SOCscr show negative and significant association with bid-ask spread. Whilst, the remaining variables of CSR practice (CSR_rep, CSR_com, CSR_ass), and ESG performance (ENVscr and GOVscr) are negatively associated with asymmetry information (Spread) but statistically insignificant. Our results suggest that CSR practice and ESG performance are weakly associated with asymmetry information, in which most of CSR practices and ESG performance need a time lag to allow them to be value relevant information in mitigating the level of asymmetry information.","On the Nexus Between CSR Practices, ESG  Performance, and Asymmetric information",2020-09-09,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,on the nexus between csr practices esg performance and asymmetric information the purpose of this paper is to test the relationship of csr practices asymmetry information and esg performance asymmetry information we conjecture that there might be a particular role where the disclosure of nonfinancial information is deemed useful in truncating the level of asymmetry information using the data from two different countries indonesia asia and portugal europe we extracted companies with time period of observation ranges from to to manifest the empirical test we use csr report csr_rep csr committee csr_com csr assurance csr_ass and gri adoption as the proxies of csr practice while the proxies of esg performance are represented by environmental envscr social socscr and governance govscr pillar scores as obtained from thomson reuters asset database bidask spread is used as the surrogate indicator of asymmetry information the empirical test reveals that only variables gri and socscr show negative and significant association with bidask spread while the remaining variables of csr practice csr_rep csr_com csr_ass and esg performance envscr and govscr are negatively associated with asymmetry information spread but statistically insignificant our results suggest that csr practice and esg performance are weakly associated with asymmetry information in which most of csr practices and esg performance need a time lag to allow them to be value relevant information in mitigating the level of information asymmetry,23387238,9

However, the lack of emprirical research to support that contention can be problematic. Utilizing the concept of fit, this study aims to examine empirically the effect of the degree of misfit between HRM practices and the types of organizational cultures on organizational performance. Data were collected from a sample comprising of 128 respondents representing 64 companies in Indonesia, from nine industrial sectors.

Resource complementarity is an important aspect that needs to be considered when carrying out mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This study uses a purposive sampling method, which has specific criteria for selecting the sample, while the dataset is cross-sectional. Tests have been conducted on 97 non-financial companies that carried out M&A in Southeast Asia between 2007 to 2017, and their post-M&A performance has been examined. This research’s methodology utilizes a quantitative approach and explanatory variables. The results indicate that resource complementarity has a significant effect on the performance of post-M&A companies. In other words, resource complementarity has a positive and significant effect on changes in the performance of companies after their M&A. The moderation test shows exciting findings, namely, for companies with little experience, the effect of resource complementarity on post-M&A performance is more substantial.

9,"This study investigated efficiency in the utilization of the individual-explicit knowledge of a firm. The sample included 42 customer service centers (CSCs) of the four most active Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) organisations in Lagos State and FCT, Nigeria. The research adopted the input-oriented data envelopment analysis model to determine the extent to which individual-explicit knowledge, as a vital input resource to telecommunications firms, is efficiently utilized by the CSCs to improve the firms’ values. The study revealed that 10 CSCs, representing 23.8 percen of those studied, were technically efficient using the constant returns to scale model. In contrast, the variable returns to scale model showed that 22 CSCs, or 52 percent of them, were technically inefficient. The results suggest that, with less than 50 percent of the total number of CSCs in Nigeria’s telecommunications industry being inefficient, there is a large volume of operational inefficiency, especially concerning the utilization of individual-explicit knowledge. As such, the telecommunications industry could benefit from managerial intervention, especially in building the capacity of the customer desk officers in the CSCs to attend promptly and accurately to customers’ queries. Also, the study established that a viable strategic direction would be that organizations in the telecommunications industry renew their focus on a balanced mix of supervisor-subordinates in each CSC. This study contributes to operations management and the organizational knowledge management literature by showcasing the data envelopment analysis methodology as a legitimate tool for improving understanding of the investigations into the efficiency of individual-explicit knowledge. This study offers practical implications for firm managers about specific activities and units of their firm that contribute the most to the organization, and other specific units/activities that are less productive.

9,"The purpose of this article is to elucidate the relations of empowering leadership on creativity and work-effort by using psychological empowerment and self-leadership. This elucidation contributes to fill the void in empirical studies by simultaneously examining the dynamics of relations among empowering leadership, creativity, work-effort, psychological empowerment, and self-leadership. The social exchange theory is applied to theoretically explain the psychological mechanisms among the constructs. As millennials are categorized as a creative generation, this study focuses on discussing the factors influencing their creativity and work-effort, with a specific notion of empowerment. This study is based on survey data (n = 113) of millennial generation employees working in digital start-up creative industries in Indonesia. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is used to estimate the model. Results of the study find that empowering leadership influences employee creativity and work-effort either directly or indirectly through psychological empowerment and self-leadership. More specifically, the psychological empowerment of employees partially mediates the influence of empowering leadership on employee creativity and employee work-effort. Employee self-leadership also partially mediates the effect of empowering leadership on psychological empowerment, creativity, and employee work-effort.

9,"The issue of firm specific strategies and how they affect organizational performance has engendered a lot of discussions in the extant literature. This creates a need to investigate the extent to which firm level strategy influences value creation in small businesses. Premised on the elements of corporate, business and functional level strategies, this study examines the influence of firm strategy on value creation in a developing economy ie. Nigeria. Employing a survey research design, 689 small business owners and managers were surveyed utilizing questionnaire research instruments. Using PLS-SEM, the study reveals that firm strategy is a driver of value creation in small businesses. The study also shows that corporate level strategy and business level strategy are the most significant drivers of value creation. The results of this study highlight critical concerns and guide small businesses through the value creation process to achieve competitiveness. Small firms should be active in the formulation and implementation of strategies that are based on value creation.

9,"Belief systems, which are one of the four levers of control, play a vital role in an organization. This study is primarily aimed at examining the effects of belief systems on managerial performance. Since the four levers of control jointly function in management control systems, we extend our study by investigating whether the contingent-fit between strategic risk, strategic uncertainty, and the other three levers of control (i.e., boundary systems, diagnostic control, and interactive control) strengthens the association between belief systems and managerial performance. A survey questionnaire was distributed to the upper-level management of various companies or strategic business units in Indonesia during the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in 81 respondents. Hypotheses testing were conducted using the OLS regression model. This research found that belief systems are positively associated with managerial performance, indicating that the implementation of effective belief systems leads to higher managerial performance. This study also found that the contingent-fit between strategic risk, strategic uncertainty, and the other three levers of control does not have any effect on how belief systems are positively associated with managerial performance. This finding indicates that although management does not adopt a fit combination between its level of strategic risk and strategic uncertainty and the boundary systems, diagnostic control, and interactive control, it can still achieve good performance as long as strong belief systems are implemented. These findings confirm the critical role of belief systems in the levers of control. Thus, management needs to ensure the establishment of more effective belief systems if the company or business unit wants to produce optimal performance.",Levers of Control and Managerial Performance: The Importance of Belief Systems,2021-07-07,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,levers of control and managerial performance the importance of belief systems belief systems which are one of the four levers of control play a vital role in an organization this study is primarily aimed at examining the effects of belief systems on managerial performance since the four levers of control jointly function in management control systems we extend our study by investigating whether the contingent fit between strategic risk strategic uncertainty and the other three levers of control i e boundary systems diagnostic control and interactive control strengthens the association between belief systems and managerial performance a survey questionnaire was distributed to the upper level management of various companies or strategic business units in Indonesia during the fourth quarter of results in respondents hypotheses testing were conducted using the OLs regression model this research found that belief systems are positively associated with managerial performance indicating that the implementation of effective belief systems leads to higher managerial performance this study also found that the contingent fit between strategic risk strategic uncertainty and the other three levers of control does not have any effect on how belief systems are positively associated with managerial performance this finding indicates that although management does not adopt a fit combination between its levels of strategic risk and strategic uncertainty and the boundary systems diagnostic control and interactive control it can still achieve good performance as long as strong belief systems are implemented these findings confirm the critical role of belief systems in the levers of control thus management needs to ensure the establishment of more effective belief systems if the company or business unit wants to produce optimal performance,23387238,9
9,"Loyalty is an essential asset for a particular brand to maintain excellent relationships with its customers and secure its continuing long-term business. An understanding customers' emotional and rational dimensions regarding brand performance is required to collect information to develop a great brand management strategy. Therefore, this study examines mediating roles of both brand love and brand trust in relation to the dimensions of brand experience (sensory, affective, intellectual, and behavioral) and brand loyalty in the coffee shop business context. A total of 225 valid questionnaires were collected from Generation Z (Gen Z) and Y (Gen Y) coffee consumers in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was selected as an analytical method to evaluate the research results. The results show that affective, intellectual, and behavioral experiences directly influence brand love and brand trust, while the sensory experience only affects brand love. Furthermore, brand love and brand trust are proven to have a direct influence on brand loyalty. Subsequently, brand love successfully mediates the effect of each dimension of brand experience on brand loyalty. In contrast, brand trust is not successful in mediating the effect of sensory experience on brand loyalty. The results also clearly show that none of the model coefficient paths are significantly moderated by generation due to the small age gap. Finally, the findings suggest what all factors that could enhance brand loyalty to achieve competitive advantages and develop marketing strategies are.

9,"The ADB takes more than five years to disburse the agreed-upon loan funds after the borrower signs the loan agreements, because of the conditionalities attached to such loans, compared with it only taking one day for commercial banks to release any agreed loans. During this five-year period, the funds stay in the bank and gain compounded interest, disfavoring Indonesia. Development studies have mostly overlooked these gains and their impacts. Knowing that ADB loans cause about 3% of Indonesia’s unemployment, we reviewed the delay’s impacts during a project’s implementation on unemployment involving 325 ADB loan projects, valued at over $33 billion, from 1969 to 2017. We used a non-econometric methodology by adopting the management principles of the project and portfolio. The results show that the ADB’s loans at 1% GDP initially helped Indonesia reduce its unemployment by 30%. However, because of the ADB’s standard implementation of five years, along with an extra two-year delay (seven years in total) we observed shorter unemployment reductions by half, but then reversed, increased and tripled joblessness. This is also causing Indonesia to suffer capital losses of $0.6 to $12 per $1 of loan money, which is equivalent to 4.98% of its GDP because of the delays in the disbursement of the funds. ADB loans have severe negative effects, with over 200% volatility because of the delays.

9,"Event marketing has been one of the popular corporate marketing strategies for decades. The method is experiential and aims to transform not only attendees' perceptions but also their behavior. Despite this, several events have failed to build loyalty or the purchase intention beyond the entertainment value. In addition, event marketing now focuses on gaining purchase and visit intentions. When a company focuses on engagement, it causes an increased usage desire and longer customer lifetime value. However, as a consequence of such communications, research into the engagement effect of an event has been lacking. This study clarifies the literature review to better understand it. This study reviews 40 relevant scholarly publications from the Scopus database to build a novel concept of engagement-driven event marketing. This article narrows the search using event marketing characteristics. Previous research has found six event types: sports, festivals, concerts, special events, trade shows, and meetings. Five factors influence the attendees: purchase intention, visit intentions, word-of-mouth, brand loyalty, and brand equity . This paper presents a new event marketing model based on Nufer (2015) and Żyminkowska (2019).

9,"This study examines the role of moral reasoning in strengthening the working relationship and incentive schemes on the likelihood of reporting accounting fraud. This study predicts that higher moral reasoning or being exposed to incentive schemes are more likely to cause someone to be a whistleblower. However, individuals with a close working relationship with wrongdoers will exhibit a lower propensity to blow the whistle than those with no close working relationship. Finally, moral reasoning is expected to interact with working relationships and incentive schemes to affect the propensity to blow the whistle. Based on a lab-experiment with 147 participants, this study documents that the simple effect of moral reasoning, the working relationship, or an incentive scheme is (marginally) significant. Similarly, the combination of moral reasoning and the working relationship significantly improves the tendency to blow the whistle. However, the combined effects of moral reasoning vs. the working relationship and moral reasoning vs. the working relationship vs. incentive scheme are not significant. This paper confirms previous studies which found that moral reasoning significantly alters the whistleblowing intention but that the impact of moral reasoning is not robust for incentive schemes and working relationships. Some limitations should be considered, namely the textual scenarios of the experimental design, working experiences, and the omission of personal orientation and the personal cost of reporting.",The Role of Moral Reasoning on the Effects of Incentive Schemes and Working Relationships on Whistleblowing: An Audit Experimental Study,2021-06-29,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the role of moral reasoning on the effects of incentive schemes and working relationships on whistleblowing an audit experimental study this study examines the role of moral reasoning in strengthening the working relationship and incentive schemes on the likelihood of reporting accounting fraud this study predicts that higher moral reasoning or being exposed to incentive schemes are more likely to cause someone to become a whistleblower however individuals with a close working relationship with wrongdoers will exhibit a lower propensity to blow the whistle than those with no close working relationship finally moral reasoning is expected to interact with working relationships and incentive schemes to affect the propensity to blow the whistle based on a lab experiment with participants this study documents that the simple effect of moral reasoning the working relationship or an incentive scheme is marginally significant similarly the combination of moral reasoning and the working relationship significantly improves the tendency to blow the whistle however the combined effects of moral reasoning vs the working relationship and moral reasoning vs the working relationship vs incentive scheme are not significant this paper confirms previous studies which found that moral reasoning significantly alters the whistleblowing intention but that the impact of moral reasoning is not robust for incentives schemes and working relationships some limitations should be considered namely the textual scenarios of the experimental design working experiences and the omission of personal orientation and the personal cost of reporting,23387238,9
9,"This study investigates the relationship between household credit and banking stability in Malaysia using a sample of 37 commercial banks spanning the period from 2008 to 2015. In analyzing household credit’s influence on the Malaysian banking sector’s stability, household credit was categorized into two components, namely mortgage and consumer credit. The Banking Stability Index (BSI) for each bank is constructed using 15 bank-specific variables and some macro-economic variables. The determinants of the BSI are estimated using a static panel data technique. The fixed-effects regression results showed a statistically significant negative relationship between both forms of household credit (mortgage credit and consumer credit) upon the banking sector’s stability.

9,"Currently, there are limited studies on the application of the social cognitive theory in social psychology, particularly in explaining and predicting panic-buying behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia.  This study is primarily aimed at acknowledging the role of the social cognitive theory’s development in explaining and predicting the panic-buying behavior of Indonesian citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic. The development of the theory is attained by combining emotions and subjective norms to predict the panic-buying behavior intention in Indonesia. Using a purposive sampling technique, the sample size consists of 350 respondents from various areas, such as Jakarta, Tangerang, and Banten. An online survey was performed as the data collection method. Social desirabilit response (SDR) test was also conducted by this study to guarantee the naturality of the replies from the respondents. Data were then analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with a two-stage approach. The result demonstrated that emotions have the highest impact on the panic-buying behavioral intention. Further, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and social outcome expectancies have the second, third, and fourth highest impacts on panic-buying behavior, respectively. In general, the social cognitive theory model developed in this study can understand, explain, and predict panic-buying behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Indonesia.

9,"Voting decisions have become a strategic tool to analyze whether voters consider an incumbent's economic policies make it worthwhile re-electing the incumbent. If a strong correlation between the information on economic policies and the election results could be proved, evidence would thus be found that government accounting captures data on the attributes of government finances, consistent with the information incorporated by constituents in their voting decisions. This study investigates the association between government accounting information and local election outcomes and observes two regional government clusters that held local elections in 2017 and 2018, in which 198 incumbents ran for office again. By employing regression analysis, this study finds that several accounting information items impact the vote acquisition of the incumbents. The specific finding is that budget accounting information has a more decisive influence on votes for the incumbents than financial accounting information does. The result implies budgetary accounting information that represents service performance is beneficial for gaining votes. The limitation that should be considered is the emphasis on the assumption of voter rationality, in which the voters accumulate performance information on the incumbents for their voting decisions.

9,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the lifestyle of Malaysians. The government has introduced various incentives to encourage contactless transactions. Malaysia has also expe- rienced a spike in e-wallet transactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is no consensus on the reasons behind the rapid increase in the usage of e-wallets. This study aims to fill a knowledge gap by incorporating government support, the perceived risk, and social influence as the potential factors affecting the use of e-wallets. Survey data were collated from 598 respondents using Google Forms and analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). The findings confirm that perceived usefulness, government support, the perceived risk, and social influence are positively related to the attitude toward the usage of e-wallets. This attitude is also positively related with the user’s intention of using the wallets. The outcomes of this study may assist policymakers to devise effective strategies that are able to capture the users’ intentions to use e-wallets during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The gambler’s fallacy occurs when markets are bullish and partially when markets are bearish. The halo effect without risk profile does not occur in either market, and the familiarity effect occurs in both markets.

9,"The consensus in the finance literature is that a large proportion of inside ownership (defined as greater than 5% share ownership by non-institutional holders, managerial holdings, founding family holdings, cross-shareholdings by affiliated firms and ownership by creditors) tends to be associated with more unsatisfactory performance (as measured by ROE or ROA) when compared to firms with lower inside ownership, all else equal. However, this need not be the case if insiders act as monitors of the firm and have the same interest in returns as outsiders.  Ownership structure and firm level financial performance have not been widely studied in Vietnam.  Using data from 729 listed firms in Vietnam for 2018, we test the hypothesis that greater insider ownership has a negative impact on firm performance.

9,"This study investigates the theoretical link between heuristic behavioral factors and the investment decision-making of women entrepreneurs, focusing on the impor­tance of financial literacy as a potential mediator shaping prudent decision-making. We argue that women’s financial literacy is an efficient way to apply behavioral considerations in wise decision making. Using the proportionate stratified sampling method, we collect­ed data from women entrepreneurs who were formally registered in Punjab Province, Pakistan. Owing to the complex model and small sample size, the smart PLS method was applied to analyze the structural relationship between the measured and latent con­structs. The results show that overconfidence and availability heuristics have a significant positive impact on investment decisions, while financial literacy plays an essential inter­vening role between the overconfidence heuristic, availability heuristic, and investment decision-making.

9,"Despite various studies into the relationship between performance and the ex­port market orientation, researchers still argue that the current findings remain mixed and inconclusive. In this study, the authors use meta-analytic techniques to examine the relationship between the export market orientation and performance, and the impact of firm-level, industry-level and country-level moderators using a total sample of 10,758 firms in 51 manuscripts from 19 countries. In particular, this study focuses on the nature of incongruent findings across studies conducted in different contexts around the globe. The results reveal that market orientation has a positive overall relationship with export­ers’ revenue-based and profit-based performance. Moreover, the moderated regression analysis results indicate that the type of construct (general versus export-specific) and firm size moderate the relationship between the export market orientation and perfor­mance.

9,"The generation gap is critical, especially when employees do not agree about some terms that affect their completion of tasks. This issue is debated in organizations, causing incompatibilities between human resource management and development structures. Hence, these constraints led this study to measure the differences shown by generations X and Y, and how they impact the relationship between psychological empowerment, employee performance, and organizational commitment. This research used questionnaires and in-depth interviews as the main procedures for collecting and obtaining data—196 items of data were received from the Malaysian Islamic Finance Agency. SmartPLS software was used to test the research hypotheses and the differences between the two groups are Gen X and Y (PLS-MGA). The results of the PLS-MGA test confirmed that, in the relationship of psychological empowerment and job performance alone, it was found there was a generational difference between X and Y (p-value < 0.05). However, while running the hypothesis test (using the bootstrapping test), it was found that both hypotheses are acceptable, which shows the relationship between psychological empowerment and job performance based on two different groups, namely Gen Y = t-statistic (10.961) and Gen X = t-statistic (11.993). Thus, H1 is supported. Meanwhile, the relationship between psychological empowerment and organizational commitment is based on two different groups, namely Gen Y = t-statistic (8.675) and Gen X = t-statistic (8.349), which means H2 is also supported. Consequently, it is hoped that the findings of this study will serve as essential guidance for employers in both the public and private sectors.

9,"The mushrooming growth of luxury brands has been evidenced worldwide, especially among developing countries such as Malaysia. Despite Malaysian consumer confidence slowing due to uncertainty about the economic conditions, the demand for luxury brands is still expected to rise. Interestingly, a significant rise in the demand for luxury brands has been observed in the millennials group. This study examines the relationship of electronic word-of-mouth and the country of origin’s image on millennials' attitudes toward luxury brands and the intention to purchase luxury fashion brands. The study among 333 millennials revealed that the country of origin’s image has both direct and indirect effects on the intention to purchase luxury fashion brands. Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) was found statistically insignificant in explaining the intention to purchase, but eWOM had a significant relationship on intention to purchase through its mediation effect of the attitude toward luxury brands. Accordingly, the findings found support for the balance theory. The results also suggest that the owners of luxury brands should carefully manage the country of origin because it will affect the overall brand image, as perceived by consumers.

9,"P2P lending offers loans to the public with easy processes and terms. However, the level of P2P lending disbursements is still lower than that of the banks. In addition, a comparison of the number of users of P2P lenders and the productive age population of Indonesia shows that there are still many people who do not use P2P lending. This paper examines the factors that make Indonesians avoid P2P lending. This study used an online survey approach for its data collection and structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the data from 499 responses. The study found that the perceived threat from P2P lending is influenced by its perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, and risk tolerance. This perceived threat and social influences cause people’s avoidance motivation. This study contributes to the fintech literature by providing empirical evidence on the avoidance of P2P lending from the borrowers’ perspectives using the TTAT model.

9,"Nowadays, consumption patterns concern consumers since they have negative impacts on environmental sustainability. Marketers have conducted some efforts to create eco-friendly products. This condition has caused research into green marketing to grow significantly. Various studies have been conducted to examine consumers' behavior intentions toward green products. However, the theory applied to explain the phenomenon still has the potential to be developed. Thus, in this study, the researchers examine the consumers' switching intention from conventional cosmetics to green cosmetics, by applying the migration theory and the push-pull-mooring framework. The push factors are explained by the dissatisfaction variable and the low-quality variable. The alternative attractiveness variable explains the pull factor. Meanwhile, the mooring factors are explained by variety-seeking and the unfavorable subjective norm variables. PLS-SEM is used to analyze 198 consumers of conventional cosmetics. The results indicate that the pull factor is the main factor that supports the consumers' switching intention to green cosmetics, and the second is the push factor. Furthermore, the mooring factors are proven to moderate the effect of the pull factor on consumers' switching intention. On the other hand, the mooring factors are not shown to moderate the influence of the push factors on the consumers' switching intention.","The Effect of Push, Pull, and Mooring Factors on Customers’ Switching Intention to Green Cosmetics",2023-09-05,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the effect of push pull and mooring factors on customers switching intention to green cosmetics nowadays consumption patterns concern consumers since they have negative impacts on environmental sustainability marketers have conducted some efforts to create ecofriendly products this condition has caused research into green marketing to grow significantly various studies have been conducted to examine consumers' behavior intentions toward green products however the theory applied to explain the phenomenon still has the potential to be developed thus in this study the researchers examine the consumers switching intention from conventional cosmetics to green cosmetics by applying the migration theory and the pushpullmooring framework the push factors are explained by the dissatisfaction variable and the lowquality variable the alternative attractiveness variable explains the pull factor while the mooring factors are explained by variety seeking and the unfavorable subjective norm variables plssem is used to analyze consumers of conventional cosmetics the results indicate that the pull factor is the main factor that supports the consumers switching intention to green cosmetics and the second is the push factor furthermore the mooring factors are proven to moderate the effect of the pull factor on consumers switching intention on the other hand the mooring factors are not shown to moderate the influence of the push factors on the consumers switching intention,23387238,9
9,"It has been established in the literature that the trading behavior of international investors may increase market vulnerability, especially for emerging markets. Consequently, this study examines whether positive feedback trading exists in the Nigerian stock market. Both descriptive and inferential analyses are carried out on monthly data covering the period 2013 to 2020.  Specifically, the ARDL bounds testing approach is employed. Findings indicate that positive feedback trading exists in the market, as stock returns have positive and significant influence on foreign portfolio inflows. The results further show that this trading pattern becomes more prominent with rising economic growth. The findings again reveal that the exchange rate and the interest rate explain the foreign portfolio inflows in the Nigerian market. The study’s outcomes lend support for the pull theory in explaining the foreign portfolio inflow. However, no evidence is found in support of the push theory, as an explanation for the foreign portfolio inflow as the “OPEC basket crude oil price” is insignificant. It is thereby recommended that regulators should adopt measures that will help foreign investors to be better informed about the Nigerian market, in order to reduce their positive feedback trading behavior. Moreso, there is a need for the government to put in place policies targeted toward enhancing the growth of the stock market and the economy.

9,"This study examines the relations between the CEO type (owner CEO vs. professional CEO) and earnings management over 9,266 firm-years from 2011 to 2020 in Korea. Two earnings management measures, accrual management and real activity management (abnormal cash flow from operations, abnormal production cost, and abnormal discretionary expense), are considered as means to avoid reporting losses or earnings decreases. We partition the sample into two groups based on the type of CEO (owner CEO vs. professional CEO) and investigate whether earnings management is used for achieving earnings targets (small profit or small earnings increases) for each group. We find all earnings management measures are significant at the 5% level or better in the direction of aggressive earnings management in the owner CEO sample, while all but one measure (abnormal production cost) are insignificant in the professional CEO sample. Our findings suggest that an owner CEO is more likely to manage earnings to achieve small profit or small earnings increases compared to a professional CEO.",CEO Type and Earnings Management to Avoid Loss or Earnings Decreases: Evidence from South Korea,2023-05-02,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,ceo type and earnings management to avoid loss or earnings decreases evidence from south korea this study examines the relationship between the ceo type owner ceo vs professional ceo and earnings management over firm years from to in korea two earnings management measures accrual management and real activity management abnormal cash flow from operations abnormal production costs and abnormal discretionary expense are considered as means to avoid reporting losses or earnings decreases we partition the sample into two groups based on the type of ceo owner ceo vs professional ceo and investigate whether earnings management is used for achieving earnings targets small profit or small earnings increases for each group we find all earnings management measures are significant at the level or better in the direction of aggressive earnings management in the owner ceo sample while all but one measure abnormal production costs are insignificant in the professional ceo sample our findings suggest that an owner ceo is more likely to manage earnings to achieve small profits or small earnings increases compared to a professional ceo,23387238,9
9,"This study analyzes the influence of entrepreneurial attitudes and individual at­tributes on entrepreneurial activity in two ASEAN member countries: Vietnam and Thai­land. By applying the multinomial logistics regression (MLR) analysis method, the results show that those with an entrepreneurial network, who can read business opportunities, and have skills and knowledge, have a positive and significant influence when deciding to start and invest in others’ new businesses. On the other hand, females and those with a secondary education were more likely to engage in entrepreneurial activities. The study also shows that Vietnam’s entrepreneurial attitudes and individual characteristics seem to be better, differentiating it from Thailand. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data from 2017 were the most recent data available at the time of this study. However, the availability of more up-to-date data is considered necessary to enrich and expand the im­pact of future research.",The Effect of Entrepreneurial Attitudes and Individual Attributes on Entrepreneurial Activity in the context of ASEAN Member States: Evidence from Thailand and Vietnam,2023-02-08,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,the effect of entrepreneurial attitudes and individual attributes on entrepreneurial activity in the context of asean member states evidence from thailand and vietnam this study analyzes the influence of entrepreneurial attitudes and individual attributes on entrepreneurial activity in two asean member countries vietnam and thailand by applying the multinomial logistics regression mlr analysis method the results show that those with an entrepreneurial network who can read business opportunities and have skills and knowledge have a positive and significant influence when deciding to start and invest in other new businesses on the other hand females and those with a secondary education were more likely to engage in entrepreneurial activities the study also shows that vietnam's entrepreneurial attitudes and individual characteristics seem to be better differentiating it from thailand the global entrepreneurship monitor gem data from were the most recent data available at the time of this study however the availability of more up to date data is considered necessary to enrich and expand the impact of future research,23387238,9
9,"This research examines the interrelationships between relationship marketing, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in e-banking’s context. The study was conducted in two phases: In-depth interviews and a quantitative survey with a sample of 690 Vietnamese individual and corporate e-banking customers. The research results show that customer satisfaction mediates the impact of relationship marketing on customer loyalty among individual customers. Meanwhile, instead of customer satisfaction, relationship marketing significantly and directly contributes to the loyalty of the corporate customer group. The significance and magnitude of the effects that the five dimensions of relationship marketing’s effectiveness have on customer satisfaction and loyalty, which include the banks’ commitment, customer experience, process-driven approach, service reliability and application of technology, are also different between the two customer segments. This study theoretically contributes to the research stream regarding the mechanism underlying the relationship between relationship marketing’s effectiveness and customer loyalty in the e-banking context, and proposes practical implications for commercial banks to effectively apply relationship marketing in the virtual business environment.",Linking Relationship Marketing to Customer Loyalty in The E-Banking Context: The Central Role of Customer Satisfaction,2024-01-05,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,linking relationship marketing to customer loyalty in the ebanking context the central role of customer satisfaction this research examines the interrelationships between relationship marketing customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in the ebanking context the study was conducted in two phases in depth interviews and a quantitative survey with a sample of vietnamese individual and corporate ebanking customers the research results show that customer satisfaction mediates the impact of relationship marketing on customer loyalty among individual customers meanwhile instead of customer satisfaction relationship marketing significantly and directly contributes to the loyalty of the corporate customer group the significance and magnitude of the effects that the five dimensions of relationship marketing effectiveness have on customer satisfaction and loyalty which include the banks commitment customer experience process driven approach service reliability and application of technology are also different between the two customer segments this study theoretically contributes to the research stream regarding the mechanism underlying the relationship between relationship marketing effectiveness and customer loyalty in the ebanking context and proposes practical implications for commercial banks to effectively apply relationship marketing in the virtual business environment,23387238,9
9,"This study empirically examines the correlation between service system innovation and competitiveness in Nigeria, an emerging market, by focusing on the country’s mobile telecommunications sector. The moderating effect of managerial competencies was also tested. Due to the contribution of the telecommunications sector to the economic well-being of Nigeria and the world’s economy at large, the sector witnesses a high level of competition among its players, resulting in unsustainable price wars, negatively impacting the telecommunication firms and their ability to invest in service improvements. Thus, there is a need for a study into the factors affecting competitiveness in the telecommunications sector. A cross sectional survey was used because the study explored the relationships between service system innovation, managerial competencies and competitiveness. The study used a survey instrument, which was sent to 450 respondents using Google Forms, out of which 230 responded. The 230 returned copies represented a 51.1 percent return rate, which satisfied the minimum required return rate for a cross sectional study. The study’s hypotheses were tested using the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The finding revealed that service system innovation (idea development, service development and commercialization) enhances the competitiveness of mobile telecommunication firms. Thus, an increase in idea development, service development and commercialization is essential for a competitive advantage. Also, managerial competencies were found to significantly moderate the relationship between service system innovation and competitiveness. The study provides a new insight into how service system innovation affects the competitiveness of telecommunications companies, particularly in emerging markets, with Nigeria as the focal point. It also shows the role managerial competencies play in the telecommunications sector. This study offers proof of the traits of service system innovation, managerial competencies, and competitiveness in the telecommunications sector. It also developed and tested a scale for measuring these variables, which future studies could adopt.",Service System Innovation and Competitiveness In an Emerging Market: The Moderating Role of Managerial Competencies,2024-01-05,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,service system innovation and competitiveness in an emerging market the moderating role of managerial competencies this study empirically examines the correlation between service system innovation and competitiveness in nigeria an emerging market by focusing on the countries mobile telecommunications sector the moderating effect of managerial competencies was also tested due to the contribution of the telecommunications sector to the economic prosperity of nigeria and the world's economy at large the sector witnesses a high level of competition among its players resulting in unsustainable price wars negatively impacting the telecommunication firms and their ability to invest in service improvements thus there is a need for a study into the factors affecting competitiveness in the telecommunications sector a cross sectional survey was used because the study explored the relationship between service system innovation managerial competencies and competitiveness the study used a survey instrument which was sent to respondents using google forms out of which responded the returned copies represented a percent return rate which satisfied the minimum required return rate for a cross sectional study the studies hypotheses were tested using the partial least squares structural equation model plssem the finding revealed that service system innovation idea development service development and commercialization enhances the competitiveness of mobile telecommunication firms thus an increase in idea development service development and commercialization is essential for a competitive advantage also managerial competencies were found to significantly moderate the relationship between service system innovation and competitiveness the study provides a new insight into how service system innovation affects the competitiveness of telecommunications companies particularly in emerging markets with nigeria as the focal point it also shows the role managerial competencies play in the telecommunications sector this study offers evidence of the traits of service system innovation managerial competencies and competitiveness in the telecommunications sector it also developed and tested a scale for measuring these variables which future studies could adopt,23387238,9
9,"This study compares the level of financial well-being (FWB) and its antecedents(financial stress, financial behaviour, financial literacy, and the internal locus of control(LOC)) across individuals of different employment categories in Malaysia. Second, it investigates the relationship between those antecedents and FWB and compares the differences in the strength. Data were collected from 1,867 respondents from four employmentgroups using a questionnaire-based survey. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to achieve the first research objective, and ordinary leastsquares (OLS) regression was used to achieve the second research objective. The resultsindicate that FWB and its antecedents of Malaysian employees vary considerably acrossemployment categories. The FWB of the unemployed and private-sector workers is significantly lower than their government sector and self-employed counterparts. Financialstress, financial behavior, and an internal LOC are the most determinative of employees’FWB, however, they have varying degrees of impact across different employment categories. The results relate to employers and policymakers in formulating strategies to promotehigher FWB among Malaysian employees, based on their employment categories.",A Comparison of Financial Well-Being and Its Antecedents Across Different Employment Categories in Malaysia,2023-09-05,GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS,a comparison of financial wellbeing and its antecedents across different employment categories in Malaysia this study compares the level of financial wellbeing fwb and its antecedents financial stress financial behavior financial literacy and the internal locus of control located across individuals of different employment categories in malaysia second it investigates the relationship between those antecedents and fwb and compares the differences in the strength data were collected from respondents from four employment groups using a questionnaire-based survey descriptive statistics and analysis of variance anova were conducted to achieve the first research objective and ordinary least squares ols regression was used to achieve the second research objective the results indicate that fwb and its antecedents of malaysian employees vary significantly across employment categories the fwb of the unemployed and private sector workers is significantly lower than their government sector and self-employed counterparts financial stress financial behavior and an internal loc are the most determinative of employeesfwb however they have varying degrees of impact across different employment categories the results relate to employers and policymakers in formulating strategies to promote higher fwb among malaysian employees based on their employment categories,23387238,9
