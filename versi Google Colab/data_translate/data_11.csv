This study discusses the aristocratic stage, a study of cultural politics in the Riau Lingga area, a cultural study perspective. The aristocratic stage is a folk theater that during the Old Order had ritual power, then during the New Order it almost became extinct. The New Order government revitalized the theater as a Malay cultural identity, but instead of developing it actually declined. The purpose of this study is to describe the process of the emergence of the aristocratic stage, to explain the role of the state in the aristocratic stage and to analyze the meaning of cultural politics in relation to the new Malay cultural identity. This study was carried out using a qualitative method. The researcher explored culture in its context with the real world and the perspective of art community actors. The first stage was the collection of primary and secondary data. The second stage was the selection of a theory to study the data. The third stage was the analysis and interpretation of the selected data. The fourth stage was the writing and construction of research results. The theory used was hegemonic aesthetics, semiotics and deconstruction. The first research result was the process of the emergence of the aristocratic stage. Its reality includes pre-stage, stage events and post-stage. During the pre-stage and post-stage periods, a discourse battle emerged with various individual or group interests. The second role of the state in the aristocratic stage gave rise to hegemony. This hegemony had an impact on the shift in the content of the story about power during the Old Order. The political system that applies following the mechanics of power pattern while the New Order era follows the poetics of power pattern. The third meaning of cultural politics in relation to Malay cultural identity is that after the revitalization of Malay culture was carried out, the understanding of Malay nature shifted. Initially it had hardened boundaries. Now these boundaries are melting. The new Malay cultural identity is not based on certain religious conventions but is more pluralistic.",23382449,11
11,"Wayang Orang (the stage show usually with the wayang theme) is a performing art of which the characters are played by people. As a specific Sasak performing art, the wayang orang which is performed in Mataram Lombok, used to use what is referred to as Serat Menak as the story source. However, such a performing art was marginalized and was almost getting extinct. Therefore, the Sasak artists and cultural observers, whom were facilitated by UPTD Taman Budaya Lombok, did their best to save such a performing art by reconstructing it. The performing art which was constructed by IPTD Taman Budaya Lombok was the Wayang Orang Darma Kerti, Dusun Batu Pandang. Such a reconstruction was made in the middle of the struggle for an identity of those living in Mataram, Lombok, who belong to different ethnic groups and religions. This present study was intended to understand the matter pertaining to the reconstruction of Wayang Orang Darma Kerti as part of the struggle for the identity of the people living in Mataram, Lombok. The qualitative method and the theories of deconstruction, multiculturalism, and hegemony were used to analyze the problems of the study. The result of the study showed that 1) there was a desire to preserve Wayang Orang as a local identity, meaning that the desire to reconstruct it was inspired by the Islamic religious value and the Wetu Telu Islamic value; 2) it was reconstructed through several stages; they are observation, inventory, and classification; finally, it was decided to reconstruct Wayang Orang performed at Dusun Batu Pandang, East Lombok in which the puppeteers and dancers from Mataram, West Lombok, were involved; the puppeteers were gathered, the themes were composed, the performance was practiced, and the Wayang Orang was performed; 3)  the implication of the reconstruction of the Wayang Orang was that the Sasak ethnic group had an art identity, and religion and culture adapted to each other as the implementation of what is referred to as adatluwirgama, and the local people’s prosperity became better.","RECONSTRUCTION OF WAYANG ORANG DARMA KERTI AT BATU PANDANG: A STRUGGLE FOR IDENTITY IN MATARAM, LOMBOK",2016-08-01,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,reconstruction of wayang orang darma kerti at batu viewing a struggle for identity in mataram lombok wayang orang the stage show usually with the wayang theme is a performing art of which the characters are played by people as a specific sasak performing art the wayang orang which is performed in Mataram Lombok used to use what is referred to as fiber menak as the story source however such a performing art was marginalized and was almost getting exclusive therefore the sasak artists and cultural observers who were facilitated by uptd taman Lombok culture did their best to save such a performing art by reconstructing it the performing art which was constructed by iptd Taman Budaya Lombok was the wayang orang darma kerti Dusun Batu Panggang such a reconstruction was made in the middle of the struggle for an identity of those living in Mataram Lombok who belong to different ethnic groups and religions this present study was intended to understand the matter relating to the reconstruction of wayang orang darma kerti as part of the struggle for the identity of the people living in Mataram lombok the qualitative method and the theories of deconstruction of multiculturalism and hegemony were used to analyze the problems of the study the results of the study showed that there was a desire to preserve wayang orang as a local identity meaning that the desire to reconstruct it was inspired by the Islamic religious value and the wetu telu Islamic value it was reconstructed through several stages they were observation inventory and classification finally it was decided to reconstruct wayang orang performed at dusun batu viewing east lombok in which the puppeteers and dancers from mataram west lombok were involved the puppeteers were gathered the themes were composed the performance was practiced and the wayang orang was performed the implications of the reconstruction of the wayang orang was that the sasak ethnic group had an art identity and religion and culture adapted to each other as the implementation of what is referred to as adatluwirgama and the local people's prosperity became better,23382449,11

11,"A change is occurring to the Sasak gandrung  performing art performed at Dasan Tereng Village, Narmada District, West Lombok District, West Nuasa Tenggara. The development of the understanding of Islam among the Sasak ethnic people has widely affected the development of such a performing art. The marginalization of the Sasak gandrung performing art cannot be separated from the limited protection given by the government, the strengthening of the religious fundamentalism, and the decrease in the supporting community’s self-confidence.  This present study is intended to identify one of the three phenomena of the marginalization of the gandrung Sasak performing art, especially the strengthening of the religious fundamentalism of the waktu lima Islam. The data were collected through observation, interview, and documents which are related to the gandrung Sasak. The data were analyzed qualitatively using the Theory of Social Practice proposed by Pierre Bourdieu. The results of the study show that the strengthening of the religious fundamentalism of waktu lima Islam caused the wetu telu Muslims to convert into waktu lima Muslims.

11,"This study was intended to present the matters pertaining to the attempts made by the vendors ‘pedagang acung’ to keep being independent in tourism sector in Bali. As working people with extremely limited capitals, the principle of giving priority to safety is applicable to them. They sell souvenirs with limited capitals obtained from various souvenir entrepreneurs coming from different parts of Bali. The risk of suffering from loss has never caused them to find any difficulty. This qualitative study was conducted in the paradigm of cultural studies. The data were presented and interpreted in the form of narrative texts which are thick descriptive in nature.   The result of the study showed that working as vendors was still a profession which contributed to the decrease in unemployment in an area. This is in line with the concept of poststructuralism that people are basically referred to as homo faber, namely, the working creature, meaning that working is highly important to man. This means that employment does not only give the opportunity to generate income but also importantly means that employment is a personal identity. As a consequence, if working is different from not working or being jobless, then such a choice does not only lead to an opposing binary but also to a hierarchical social division and a structured social gap between those who are employed and those who are not.

(2) How are motivating andattracting factors related to tourism as reflected in the travelling women articulated on the novelsof Daisy Miller, A Passage to India, and Pada Sebuah Kapal?. (3) How do cultural barriersoccur in tourism as reflected in the travelling women on Daisy Miller, a Passage to India, andPada Sebuah Kapal novel? In general, this research is to find out the comparison of travellingdone by women. Specifically, it is to discover the reflection of tourism, how the motivating andattracting factors and cultural barriers occur in tourism as reflected in the travelling done bywomen.This research is conducted on three novels, Daisy Miller written by Henry James, APassage To India by E.M. Forster, and Pada Sebuah Kapal by NH. Dini called comparativeliterature showing the continents of America, Europe and Asia. Discussing the three continents,this research is called global literature. Hermeneutic method was used to interpret the content ofthose three novels by employing deconstruction, postcolonial and feminism theories. The maindata were taken from those novels and the location of the research was both at private librariesand state libraries or institutions and websites. To support the main data, secondary data werealso needed, which in this case, were obtained by interviewing the women who have travelledabroad. Then the results were formally and informally presented.The findings show that the reflection of tourism in travelling done by women is representedby family companion, and that the means of transportation to their destinations are indigenousmeans of transportation and that the tourist objects visited are art metamorphosis, travel hyperreality,sacred places and natural and human recreational places. The factors motive ting thewomen to travel are inter personal, cultural, status and prestige. The things making theminterested in travelling are: the Castle of Chillon in Switzerland and the regions’s history, theevening party in Italy as a tradition to welcome new people, the architectures of Caesars’Palaces, the Coliseum and Chandrapore club as a tradition to welcome new people, the bridge party to know the language spoken and dress worn – traditional costumes of India, Koyasan asBuddhist religion and Paris as the centre of dress model. Cultural barriers refer to differentetiquettes, ideologies and moral values resulting in different ways of travelling and theirsolutions.Knowing the culture of the destination that is going to be visited is really needed, at least inorder not to know nothing at all about such a destination; furthermore, it reduces culturalbarriers.

11,"Sidewalk traders, as informal economic sector, have been in existence in almost allthe cities in Indonesia. As an impact of migration of people, they have been recognized as astructural phenomenon which will always exist. They will always exist in Denpasar City. InWest Denpasar Sub District, as part of Denpasar City, their existence has been assumed notonly to cause the city to look disorganized but it has also been assumed to create discomfortand to disturb public order. However, as Indonesian citizens, they have the right to haveoccupation and live properly as stated in Article 27 of the 1945 Constitution. Theempowerment management of the sidewalk traders in West Denpasar Sub District refers tothe Local Rules and Regulations (Perda) of number 3 of Year 2000. However, the fact inthe field shows that what has been expected has not been properly coming true yet.Based on this fact, a research was conducted with the problems formulated asfollows: 1) how the government managed the empowerment of the sidewalk traders; 2)what responses were given by the community to the model of such a management ofempowerment; 3) and what were its effects and meanings. As a consequence, this researchaims at 1) identifying the management of empowerment of the sidewalk traders; 2)identifying the responses given by the community to the model of such a management ofempowerment; 3) identifying its effects and meanings. From the aspect of methodology,this research is classified as a qualitative one. The theory of deconstruction, the theory ofhegemony, the theory of response, the theory of motivation and achievement wereemployed for exploring the problems formulated above. The techniques employed forcollecting the data needed were the technique of observation, the technique of interview,the technique of observation and focus discussion group.The findings show that the Local Rules and Regulations (Perda) of Number 3 of2000, which is derived from the Local Rules and Regulations (Perda) of Number 15 ofYear 1993, which is used as the reference of how such a management of empowerment isconducted, does not accommodate the problems related to the sidewalk traders.

11,"At the dawn of this third millennium, growing numbers of forums worldwide are focused on the issue of how to sustain the diversity of the nature and of cultures for the well-being of the Earth and humanity. Concurrently, intercultural and interreligious dialogue is deemed essential for social cohesion. This dissertation advances the contributions of religiosity in art through a qualitative reflective account and chronicle of the art and dialogues offered by people of diverse cultures and faiths from 1999 to 2004 during Sharing Art &amp; Religiosity in the vicinity of Pura Samuan Tiga in Bedulu, Bali and Sharing Art Ocean– Mountain at  the  seacoast village of Tejakula, North  Bali;  seen in  tandem  with creative transformations that occurred through Sharing Art in and with other cultural environments of the world. Methodologically this study stemmed from and demonstrates the merits of public participatory   practice-based   art   programs   whereby   activities   are   conceived   by   and implemented with the people of a locale. Participants generated the data and interpretations via mutual cooperation, dialogue, and creative praxis. The Balinese principle of Tri Hita Karana, that aims toward a harmonious human-nature-God/Source of Life relationship in accord with the place-time-conditions, provided a holistic perspective to analyze and derive meaning from the results. Findings indicate sharing in the arts, religiosity, and nature fosters a common field such that traditional and modern cultures can study and engage in creative dialogue together. Moreover, interreligious innovations that have continued to develop since the seminal deliberation  of  reconciliation  between  Bali  Aga,  Çiwaist,  and  Buddhist  faith  groups  at Samuan Tiga circa CE 989 to 1011 and intercultural egalitarian innovations since the seventeenth century dialogue of indigenous and migrant mountain and maritime cultures in Tejakula – constitute a model for furthering bhinneka tunggal ika unity in diversity in the world today. Recommendations outline how the findings can be used for cooperative exchanges between villages and between villages and cities of diverse regions and countries to support interculture in cultural environments. Appendices provide two video compact discs; seventy- nine  reflective  essays  by artists,  religious/spiritual leaders,  scholars,  and  educators  from across the world; and nine transcriptions of initial public dialogues.","RELIGIOSITY IN ART INSPIRED BY SAMUAN TIGA AND TEJAKULA, BALI: UNITY IN DIVERSITY",2012-11-26,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,religiosity in art inspired by samuan tiga and tejakula bali unity in diversity at the dawn of this third millennium growing numbers of forums worldwide are focused on the issue of how to sustain the diversity of the nature and of cultures for the well-being of the earth and humanity concurrently intercultural and interreligious dialogue is deemed essential for social cohesion this dissertation advances the contributions of religiosity in art through a qualitative reflective account and chronicle of the art and dialogues offered by people of diverse cultures and faiths from during sharing art religiosity in the vicinity of pura samuan tiga in bedulu bali and sharing art ocean mountain at the seacoast village of tejakula north bali seen in tandem with creative transformations that occurred through sharing art in and with other cultural environments of the world methodologically this study stemmed from and demonstrates the merits of public participatory practice-based art programs whereby activities are conceived by and implemented with the people of a locale participants generated the data and interpretations via mutual cooperation dialogue and creative praxis the Balinese principle of tri hita karana that aims toward a harmonious human nature godsource of life relationship in accord with the place time conditions provided a holistic perspective to analyze and derive meaning from the results findings indicate sharing in the arts religiosity and nature fosters a common field such that traditional and modern cultures can study and engage in creative dialogue together moreover interreligious innovations that have continued to develop since the seminal deliberation of reconciliation between bali aga çiwaist and buddhist faith groups at samuan tiga circa ce to and intercultural egalitarian innovations since the seventeenth century dialogue of indigenous and migrant mountain and maritime cultures in Tejakula constitutes a model for furthering unity in diversity in the world today recommendations outline how the findings can be used for cooperative exchanges between villages and between villages and cities of diverse regions and countries to support interculture in cultural environments appendices provide two video compact discs seventy nine reflective essays by artists religious spiritual leaders scholars and educators from across the world and nine transcriptions of initial public dialogues,23382449,11

Seks selalu menarik untuk diwacanakan dan dipraktekkan, tapi selalu menimbulkan kontradiksi di masyarakat. Sementara itu kasus-kasus akibat seks bebas terus muncul. Remaja merupakan usia yang paling rentan terkena masalah seksual. Seks bebas menurut pendapat remaja adalah hubungan seks antara dua individu tanpa ikatan perkawinan. Pendapat yang paling ekstrim menganggap semua aktivitas seksual apabila pikiran mengarah ke hubungan seks merupakan seks bebas.

11,"This study is intended to analyze the discourse of Bali TV coverage on the Kemoning –Budaga case, Bali, a conflict which took place on 17 September 2011, which  led to discourse of the dispersal of the traditional village ‘desa pakraman’. Such coverage of the case was considered blaming the Governor of Bali, Mangku Pastika. He was reported to intend to disperse the traditional villages in Bali. The Bali TV and Bali Post, which are under the Bali Post Media Group ‘Kelompok Media Bali Post’ (abbreviated to KMB) continuously exploited the discourse of the dispersal of the traditional village subjectively. The Governor of Bali, Mangku Made Pastika, did not accept that and prosecuted the Bali Post in Denpasar Court of First Instance ‘Pengadilan Negeri Denpasar’. The theory of discourse, the theory of agenda setting, the framing theory, and the theory of semiotics are used in the present study.   The result of the analysis shows that the conflict between Kemoning Village and Budaga Village covered by the Bali Post was an extended discourse of the Bali Post printed media which was managed using a clear setting agenda for the social, political, and ideological interests of the KMB’s Ajeg Bali.  The relation between the Governor of Bali, Mangku Made Pastika, and KMB, which was good in the beginning, changed into a serious conflict.

The family planning program was launched with a gender perspective, but in its implementation there was an imbalance in the number of female acceptors, more than male acceptors. Therefore, more women suffered from side effects. It is interesting to study by formulating the problem as follows: What are the forms of driving factors and the impact of state hegemony and women's resistance in the implementation of family planning programs? This study aims to realize gender equality in the implementation of family planning programs and minimize side effects for acceptors. Data was collected through in-depth interviews and document studies. Data analysis was qualitative. Data consisted of qualitative data supported by quantitative data sourced from informants and literature. The theories applied were Gramsci's hegemony theory, radical feminist Dworkin's theory of Gandhi's feminism, and De Witt's theory of resistance. The results of the study illustrate that state hegemony is manifested in the form of socialization and recommendations for the use of more contraceptives for women through the Banjar and Clinic systems. The factors driving hegemony are ideological, economic, provision of contraceptives, location of socialization, and government policies. The impact of Positive hegemony over the state can reduce the population gradually. State hegemony also has a positive impact on fertile couples in forming small families. State hegemony, in addition to having a positive impact on women physically, psychologically, and economically, women's resistance to state hegemony takes the form of not wanting to use contraception, stopping using contraception and replacing contraception with a calendar system. Based on the findings above, it is recommended that further research of a similar type be carried out with a wider scope related to the causes of side effects.",23382449,11

The theories used are the theory of practice, the theory of subaltern, the theory of semiotics, and the theory of identity.   Before the temple was constructed the Hindus at Senduro Village was classified as the followers of what is referred to as Kejawen. The reason was that their religious practice was highly specific and different from the religious practices performed by the Hindus in the other areas. After the Mandara Giri Semeru Agung Temple was constructed, the Hindus at Senduro Village were affected by the Balinese in the way in which they perform their religious practice. Such an impact could be observed from the aspect of their tattwa (philosophy), the aspect of their religious ritual, and the aspect of their religious organization.","RELIGIOUS PRACTICE PERFORMED BY THE HINDUS  AT SENDURO VILLAGE, LUMAJANG, EAST JAVA",2015-02-01,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,religious practice performed by the Hindus at Senduro Village Lumajang East Java Hindus who are stronger culturally economically and symbolically affect the religious practice performed by the Hindus at Senduro village in regard to their tatwa philosophy ritual events and organization the problems formulated in this article are as follows the forms the contributing factors and the meaning of the religious practice performed by the Hindus at Senduro village the qualitative method was used to obtain the data needed in the present study the theories used are the theory of practice the theory of subaltern the theory of semiotics and the theory of identity before the temple was constructed the hindus at senduro village was classified as the followers of what is referred to as kejawen the reason was that their religious practice was highly specific and different from the religious practices performed by the hindus in the other areas after the mandara giri semerugung temple was constructed the hindus at senduro village were affected by the balinese in the way in which they perform their religious practice such an impact could be observed from the aspect of their tattwa philosophy the aspect of their religious ritual and the aspect of their religious organization,23382449,11

11,"Conflict among parties of subak ecosystem is a conflict of interests resulting from themodernization made by political community with regard to the subculture ofpelemahan of ecosystem. The political and economic communities forcemodernization on the subak ecosystem leading to an ideological conflict betweenmodernism and the philosophy of Trihita Karana. Modernism has been responsiblefor the conflict among the parties of ecosystem in palemahan, pawongan andparhyangan of the subaks irrigated by Sabha River.Participation in group discussion, semi structured interview and transek were themethods employed in collecting the data. The triangulation including at least threerelevant theories was employed for analyzing the data.Political communities interfere with the development by applying the theoryof hegemony. The political community in collaboration with the economic communitydominates modernization which is sectoral in nature and the planning andimplementation of the development. Partial development approach, which contrastswith the theory of ecosystem (Pollunin, 1996), causes the farming community lifeprocess and the cultural values existing in the ecosystem of the subak to degrade. Theinterference of the political community in collaboration with the economiccommunity with the subak ecosystem is more dominant in the subculture ofpalemahan which is materialistic in nature so that advantages can be obtained byscience and technology. Consequently, the philosophical values of trihita karana arebroken. Such a conflict takes place due to the different interests in the subakecosystem , which is full of cultural values for the farming community. Alteration tothe land status, the imbalance between the cost spent and the yields produced and theviolation of the growing pattern are responsible for the conflict.The institution of subak, which constitutes the realization of subculture of thesubak ecosystem, is swept aside by the political and economic communities. Thefarming community members that are the members of the subak institution are madenot to be facilitated to take part in the development process in the subculture ofpalemahan . Modernization in the subculture of palemahan of the subak ecosystemdone by the political and economic communities is beyond the subak institutioncausing it to violate the traditional values of the subak institution which refer totogetherness regulated by the subak rules and regulations. Modernization, which isdone by the political and economic societies by science and technology, breaks theunified existence of Trihita Karana in the subak ecosystem environment.Modernization in the development of the subculture of palemahan ecosystem degrades the spiritual values attached to the subculture of parahyangan. Thedevelopmental intervention in the subculture of palemahan done by the political andeconomical communities is not begun from the implementation of the subculture ofparahyangan. This contrasts with the cultural values existing in the subak ecosystem.The conflict of subak ecosystem among the parties results from the failure ofmodernization. The developmental intervention is only done in the subculture ofpalemahan, while the subcultures of pawongan and parahyangan of the subakecosystem are marginalized from their habitats. The failure in developing theinfrastructure of the subculture of palemahan of the subak ecosystem in the areasirrigated by Sabha River results from the fact that the subaks are functioned to be thedevelopmental objects. In this case, the theory of participatory can offer solutions tothe conflict and the developmental failure, especially in the ecosystem of subaksirrigated by Sabha River. The reason is that the parties play equal roles in developingthe environment of the subak ecosystem.",CONFLICT AMONG PARTIES IN MODERNIZATION OF ECOSYSTEMS AT SUBAKS LOCATED IN BULELENG AND TABANAN REGENCIES OF BALI AT IRRIGATED BY SHABA RIVER,2012-11-26,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,conflict among parties in modernization of ecosystems at subaks located in buleleng and tabanan regencies of bali at irrigated by shaba river conflict among parties of subak ecosystem is a conflict of interests resulting from the modernization made by political community with regard to the subculture of weakening of ecosystem the political and economic communities force modernization on the subak ecosystem leading to an ideological conflict between modernism and the philosophy of trihita karana modernism has been responsible for the conflict among the parties of ecosystem in palemahan pawongan and parhyangan of the subaks irrigated by sabha river participation in group discussion semi structured interview and transect were the methods employed in collecting the data the triangulation including at least three relevant theories was employed for analyzing the data political communities interfere with the development by applying the theory of hegemony the political community in collaboration with the economic community dominates modernization which is sectoral in nature and the planning and implementation of the development partial development approach which contrasts with the theory of ecosystem pollution causes the farming community life process and the cultural values ​​existing in the ecosystem of the subak to degrade the interference of the political community in collaboration with the economic community with the subak ecosystem is more dominant in the subculture of paringan which is materialistic in nature so that advantages can be obtained by science and technology according to the philosophical values ​​of trihita karana are broken such a conflict takes place due to the different interests in the subacosystem which is full of cultural values ​​for the farming community alteration to the land status the imbalance between the costs spent and the yields produced and the violation of the growing pattern are responsible for the conflict the institution of Subak which constitutes the realization of subculture of the Subak ecosystem is swept aside by the political and economic communities the farming community members that are the members of the Subak institution are made not to be facilitated to take part in the development process in the subculture of Palaksanaan modernization in the subculture of Palemahan of the Subak ecosystem carried out by the political and economic communities is beyond the Subak institution causing it to violate the traditional values ​​of the Subak institution which refers to togetherness regulated by the subak rules and regulations modernization which is done by the political and economic societies by science and technology breaks the unified existence of trihita karana in the subak ecosystem environment done by the political and economical communities does not begin from the implementation of the subculture of parahyangan this contrasts with the cultural values ​​existing in the subak ecosystem the conflict of subak ecosystem among the parties results from the failure of modernization the developmental intervention is only carried out in the subculture of Pabelasan while the subcultures of Pawongan and Parahyangan of the subake ecosystem are marginalized from their habitats the failure in developing the infrastructure of the subculture of Palemahan of the Subak ecosystem in the areas irrigated by Sabha River results from the fact that the subaks are functioned to be the developmental objects in this case the theory of participatory can offer solutions to the conflict and the developmental failure especially in the ecosystem of subacrigated by sabha river the reason is that the parties play equal roles in developing the environment of the Subak ecosystem,23382449,11

The study used the theory of formula, the theory of semiotics, and the theory of practice, especially the practice of capital. The data were collected using the techniques of observation, interview, and documentation. Sa Ngaza is unique in regard to its pattern of formula in the same dimension in general and in the opening and closing formulas in particular. These formulas support the transmission of TLS, causing mori Sa Ngaza (the Sa Ngaza reporter) to be able to maintain the continuity of TLS and its growth in RA and RKA. The opening formula explains the identities of the characters. The thematic formula in RA and RKA reports different contents. TLS in RA emphasizes patadela (the ancestor’s massage); TLS in RKA emphasizes the Biblical massage. The meaning plurality in RA and RKA explains the acculturative relationship between the tradition and religion. In this relationship there is a shift in the identities of the characters, sa’o (the traditional house), and patadela.

11,"Tektekan Calonarang is a Calonarang drama dance which is performed for a new model of tourism, and is accompanied with what is referred to gamelan tektekan. In general, the Balinese people disagree that a sacred cultural element is performed for tourism. However, those living at Baturiti Village support the commodified Tektekan Calongarang in which what are referred to as sacred barong and rangda are performed. This has led to many questions as such a performing art contrasts with the Balinese people’s attitude in general. The problems of the present study are formulated as follows: why the people living at Baturiti Village, Kerambitan, Tabanan,  support the commodified Tektekan Calongarang using the sacred rangda and barong; what was such a commodification like; what was its implication on those who were involved in it, society, and such a performance itself. This present study is a qualitative one in which a number of related critical theories were used such as the theory of deconstruction proposed Jacques Derrida, the theory of social practice proposed by Pierre Bourdieu, and the theory of power/knowledge proposed by Michael Foucault. The result of the study showed that the commodified Tektekan Calonarang in which the sacred barong and rangda were used was performed in the forms of a procession and the Tektekan Calonarang performance.

11,"Since the New Order government the religious politics has obliged residents to adhere to one of the five official religions, causing the Mbawa society to be a plural one. They have welcome Christianity and Islam, but they still maintain their old belief, that is, Parafu. Movements have appeared in the society. The people were between peace and conflict. The last movements led to violence, taking place in 1969, 1972, and 2000. The Raju cultural practice is maintained within the context of Islamic and Christian contestations, and has been used as the arena of cultural fight. This present study discusses how the Raju ritual frees itself and its supporting people from the conflict, and how it is transformed into a means of supervising peace. The perspective of the critical theory was used in the present study to explore the texts of the Mbawa society. The discourse analysis was used to guide the discussion. Based on the fieldwork done at Mbawa from 2011 to 2014, several constructions of the Raju cultural practices were found. First, the Raju practice refers to the maintenance of identity and supremacy of the Mbawa society as conserver of the ancestor’s tradition; second, the Raju cultural practice functions as a mechanism of internal solidarity, so horizontal conflict can be avoided; and third, the Raju cultural practice plays a role as a means of revealing the “resistance” to as well as “acceptance” of the other people’s cultural domination. The finding of the study gives better understanding of the tradition-based management of conflict. It is such a character which, to some extent, has caused the Raju cultural practice to be the practice of management conflict.

The study is intended to (1) find out the resolution of the traditional conflict between Kemoning Traditional Village and Budaga Traditional Village which was dominated by MajelisUtamaDesaPakraman (MUDP); (2) identify the mechanism through which the decision was made by MUDP to settle such a traditional conflict; (3) identify the implication of the settlement of such a traditional conflict on the relationship between Budaga Traditional Village and Kemoning TraditionalVillage after the decision was made by MUDP. This present study is also aimed at finding out the picture of such a conflict between the two traditional villages. The study used the qualitative method.  The data were collected through observation, interview, library research, and documentary study. The theoretical approach which includes the theory of hegemony, the theory of mediation, and the theory of deconstruction was also used. The result of the study shows that the local traditional law ‘awig-awigdesapakaraman’ could not always be used as a reference to settle the dispute between the two villages. Every attempt made by the MUDP in relation to the resolution which was proposed in the earlier stages was considered unfair. The mechanism through which such a conflict was settled was dominated by the MUDP and did not show any decision which reflected the principles of mediation. The implication of the settlement of such a conflict between the two traditional villages was that the relationship between them had not been in harmony.","RESOLUTION OF TRADITIONAL CONFLICT BETWEEN KOMUNING TRADITIONAL VILLAGE AND BUDAGA TRADITIONAL VILLAGE IN KLUNGKUNG, BALI",2016-08-01,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,resolution of traditional conflict between komuning traditional village and budaga traditional village in klungkung bali this present study discusses the traditional conflict between budaga traditional village and kemoning traditional village klungkung regency bali province the study is intended to find out the resolution of the traditional conflict between kemoning traditional village and Budaga traditional village which was dominated by Majlisutamadesapakraman Mudp identify the mechanism through which the decision was made by Mudp to settle such a traditional conflict identify the implications of the settlement of such a traditional conflict on the relationship between budaga traditional village and kemoning traditional village after the decision was made by mudp this present study is also aimed at finding out the picture of such a conflict between the two traditional villages the study used the qualitative method the data were collected through observation interview library research and documentary study the theoretical approach which includes the theory of hegemony the theory of mediation and the theory of deconstruction was also used the result of the study shows that the local traditional law awigawigdesapakaraman could not always be used as a reference to settle the dispute between the two villages every attempt made by the mudp in relation to the resolution which was proposed in the earlier stages was considered unfair the mechanism through which such a conflict was settled was dominated by the mudp and did not show any decision which reflected the principles of mediation the implications of the settlement of such a conflict between the two traditional villages was that the relationship between them had not been in harmony,23382449,11
11,"This research explores the socio-political dynamics taking place at KutaTraditional Village, Bali: from desa adat (traditional village) to desa pekraman (anothertype of traditional village) in the perspective of cultural studies. There are three problemsformulated in this research. The first problem is how the socio-political dynamics fromdesa adat (traditional village) to desa pekraman (another type of traditional village) tookplace at Kuta? The next problem is how the traditional village interacted with theadministrative village at Kuta? And the last problem, which is the third, is what were theimpacts and meanings of the change from desa adat to desa pekraman? In this studyqualitative method was employed. And the data needed was obtained by employing thetechnique of in-depth interview, the technique of participatory observation, anddocumentation study. To give responses to the problems mentioned above, the theory ofhegemony, the theory of deconstruction, the theory of conflict, the theory of power andknowledge and the theory of eclectically symbolic interaction were applied.The findings show that the socio-political dynamics taking place Kuta TraditionalVillage resulted in turbulence among the villagers. This is indicated by the Local Rulesand Regulations (Perda) issued by Desa Pekraman of Number 3 of Year 2001. Thiscould be responsible for the factors of pro’s and con’s in various aspects. Clause (6) ofArticle 3 of the Perda of Number 3 of Year 2001 was reversed by the leaders of KutaTraditional Village. They did not agree that non-Hindu people were included as thetraditional village members.As far as the interaction between the traditional village and the administrativevillage is concerned, the governmental hegemony took place. The government appliedhegemony to the traditional village through the administrative village in the form of rulesand regulations. The local rules and regulations issued by the desa pekraman, as a legalproduct in Bali, are left crystallized sociologically, philosophically, and juridically. However, the dynamism of the traditional villagers in Bali will “justify” to what extentsuch rules and regulations are justified and to what extent they are protective. The changeof the Perda issued by the desa adat into that issued by the desa pekraman was notfollowed by Kuta Traditional Village by replacing the awig-awig (rules and regulations)issued by the desa adat or making loose agreements to adapt to the higher rules andregulations in addition to anticipating the migrants through the change in rules andregulations applicable at Kuta Traditional Village. Basically, the socio-political dynamicstaking place at Kuta Traditional Village as a consequence of the change made from desaadat to desa pekraman resulted in no important things. However, from the “substance”point of view, the change can be seen in the formation of Majelis Desa Pekraman (theAssembly of Desa Pekraman) (Article 14), which is formed from below, and in theappearance of pecalang (traditional security) which is responsible for the security andorderliness of the village area especially when traditional and religious activities areperformed. Actually, pecalang is an “old product” which is newly packaged with “newenthusiasm” and is included in the Perda of Number 3 of Year 2001 issued by the DesaPekraman . The meanings created by the change made from Desa Adat to DesaPekraman are transformational, dialogic and dynamic. The desa pekraman is in the ongoingprocess (which will never come to an end) of being integrated into theadministrative village.The findings show that there were multiple interpretations given by the leaders ofKuta Traditional Village, as far as the articles in the Perda issued by the Desa Pekramanare concerned, governmental hegemony which was in the form of Rules and Regulationsas the social transformation of the State by which villages are organized.","SOCIO-POLITICAL DYNAMICS TAKING PLACE AT KUTA TRADITIONAL VILLAGE, BALI: FROM DESA ADAT (TRADITIONAL VILLAGE) TO DESA PEKRAMAN (ANOTHER TYPE OF TRADITIONAL VILLAGE) IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF CULTURAL STUDIES",2012-11-26,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,sociopolitical dynamics taking place at kuta traditional village bali from adat village traditional village to pekraman village another type of traditional village in the perspective of cultural studies this research explores the sociopolitical dynamics taking place at kutatraditional village bali from adat traditional village to pekraman village another type of traditional village in the perspective of cultural studies there are three problems formulated in this research the first problem is how the sociopolitical dynamics from traditional village to pekraman village another type of traditional village took place at kuta the next problem is how the traditional village interacted with the administrative village at kuta and the last problem which is the third is what were the impacts and meanings of the change from traditional village to pekraman village in this study qualitative method was employed and the data needed was obtained by employing the technique of in-depth interview the technique of participatory observation and documentation study to give responses to the problems mentioned above the theory of hegemony the theory of deconstruction the theory of conflict the theory of power and knowledge and the theory of eclectically symbolic interaction were applied the findings show that the sociopolitical dynamics taking place kuta traditional village resulted in turbulence among the villagers this is indicated by the local rules and regulations perda issued by village pekraman of number of year this could be responsible for the factors of pros and cons in various aspects clause of article of the perda of number of year was reversed by the leaders of kuta traditional village they did not agree that non-hindu people were included as the traditional village members as far as the interaction between the traditional village and the administrative village is concerned the governmental hegemony took place the government applied hegemony to the traditional village through the administrative village in the form of rules and regulations the local rules and regulations issued by the village of pekraman as a legal product in bali are left crystallized sociologically philosophically and juridically but the dynamism of the traditional villagers in Bali will justify to what extent such rules and regulations are justified and to what extent they are protective the change of the perda issued by the village adat into that issued by the village pekraman was not followed by Kuta Traditional Village by replacing the awigawig rules and regulations issued by the adat village or making loose agreements to adapt to the higher rules and regulations in addition to anticipating the migrants through the change in rules and regulations applicable at kuta traditional village basically the sociopolitical dynamics taking place at kuta traditional village as a consequence of the change made from adat village to pekraman village resulted in no important things however from the substance point of view the change can be seen in the formation of pekraman village assembly the assembly of pekraman village article which is formed from below and in the appearance of pecalang traditional security which is responsible for the security and orderliness of the village area especially when traditional and religious activities are performed actually pecalang is an old product which is newly packaged with new enthusiasm and is included in the perda of number of year issued by the desapekraman the words created by the change made from adat village to desapekraman are transformational dialogic and dynamic the desa pekraman is in the ongoing process which will never come to an end of being integrated into the administrative village the findings show that there were multiple interpretations given by the leaders of kuta traditional village as far as the articles in the perda issued by the village of pekramanare concerned governmental hegemony which was in the form of rules and regulations as the social transformation of the state by which villages are organized,23382449,11

The data were collected using the techniques of observation, in-depth interview, documentary study, and library research. The data were qualitatively analyzed. The results of the study showed that there were several forms of marginalization occurring to the Parwa Leather Puppet ‘Wayang Kulit Parwa’ (WKP) in Gianyar Regency.

The forms of the context of performance were made up of the facts that (a) the viewers shifted from the young generation to the old generation; (b) it used to be performed as an offering but now it was performed as a commodity or comodification; (c) technology played more important roles (the lighting, sound system, and the material for making the puppet), and d) the accompanying gamelan orchestra changed. Marginalization was indicated by (a) the fall in the frequency of performance, (b) WKP was getting less popular in the community; (c) fewer people were getting interested in WKP performance; and (e) WKP was getting less respected. The factors responsible for the marginalization of WKP in Gianyar Regency were the facts that less people were interested in WKP, the decrease in the WKP puppeteer’s activities, the policy issued by the traditional institution was weak, and the supervision made by the local government of Gianyar was weak. In addition, WKP was less prospective; the current community needed more amusement than guidance, the rise in the impact of foreign cultural art, more and more sources of modern amusements were made available, and the impact of telecommunication technology.

11,"The phenomenon of forest clearance is a holistic problem which has caused a forest not to function optimally. The first consequence of forest clearance is felt by the people living around the forest. It can lead to fire, landslide and the disappearance of water source. It can also cause the micro climate to decrease. The theories used in the present study are the theory of power discourse and knowledge proposed by Foucault, the theory of hegemony proposed by Antonio Gramci, and the theory of communication action, proposed by Habermas.   It was found that; first, those who cleared the trees growing in the forest area away come from the surrounding villages. The culture of such a forest clearance had been done from generation to generation. The closer they lived to the forest area, the more cattle they raised. They raised more or less four cattle without being supported with how to prepare the food they need. Second, the government had made many attempts to overcome the forest clearance at the Kubu Forest Management Resort “Resor Pengelolaan Hutan (RPH) Kubu”; however, the attempts which it had made was not well communicated.

Sukawati has Sukawati art market and Guwang market, art shops,craftsmen, wood carvers, painters, traditional and contemporary artists. They all completethe atmosphere at Sukawati. As a result, more and more people intend to build housesthere for which more and more electric energy is needed. This study was conducted toevaluate the use of electric energy at Sukawati District. The problems are formulated asfollows: how electric energy is used; how comodification takes place; how thegovernment and Perusahaan Listrik Negara, abbreviated to PLN (the Utility Company)dominates people and how the people resist the government’s hegemony, what are theeffects and meanings of the electric energy used at Sukawati District.Qualitative method supported by quantitative data, which characterize CulturalStudies, was adopted in this study. The data were taken from primary resources andsecondary resources. Qualitative method was eclectically employed for analyzing thedata supported by the theory of consumer behavior, the theory of comodification, thetheory of hegemony, the theory of knowledge and power and the theory ofdeconstruction. The results of the study were formally presented using tables, graphs andpictures and were informally narrated.The results of the study show that the increase in the number of population hasresulted in the increase in the number of traditional houses without/with slightmodification and modern houses. The rise in the number of houses has resulted in the risein electricity needed for illumination, mechanical purposes and so forth. The peopleliving at traditional houses use less and simpler electric utilities than those living atmodern houses. The electric utilities used are highly influenced by both internal andexternal factors. The advertisements of electric utilities also contribute to the use ofelectric utilities, meaning that electricity has touched what is required by the people atSukawati District. By referring to the 1945 Constitution, the PLN has dominated thedistribution of electricity.

11,"Globalization with all its implications has affected the life of Dayak Lawangan living in Central Dusun. Modernization has caused balian bawo to be getting scarce. The number of the speakers of balian bawo is decreasing, and it seems that no young generation is interested in it, although its existence still functions in various aspects of the Dayak Lawangan community’s life. In addition, the young generation is less interested in becoming balian bawo. This will affect the process of the regeneration of balian bawo. The result of the present study shows that the practice of balian waho is obtained through the myth and process of becoming balian bawo. This causes balian bawo to be the central position in the practice of balian bawo ritual. Balian waho plays an important role in the healing and purifying processes. It functions to prevent both manifest and latent misfortunes. It is the socio-cultural supporting life regulation for Dayak Lawangan. It is made up of religiosity, culture conservation, social life, and aesthetics. The formal education, the discontinuity of the internationalization process in families, the low income earned by those who work as balian bawo, their risky responsibility, the spiritual and physical abilities they need, and their religious and psychological ideologies have caused those who are interested in becoming balian bawo to decrease. The impacts are that the dimensions of time and magic formula as part of the ritual practice will change. In addition, the ideological struggle for the ritual practice of balian bawo, and the change in the population of balian waho will also result from the scarcity of the population of balian waho.

11,"The development of technology, the economic system, and the culture of new music, has caused the Balinese pop music to be industrialized since 1990s. The existence of many recording studios and musicians (composers, singers, and music players) and many other related products all over Bali has also contributed to this. Through the recording products, various types of direct performances and so forth have caused the Balinese pop music to be the commodity of the capitalistic pop culture which is preferred by society.

This present study was conducted in order to identify the phenomenon of one of three powers in such industrialization, namely, the power of media, especially television. The result of the study shows that the power of television media in the industrialization of the Balinese pop music is the resource which contributes to the distribution of products which are produced for the market or the prospective market in Bali.

11,"This study discusses “Democra cy and Autonomy Transformation in theGovernance of Mengwi Village in the Transition Era: A Cultural StudiesPerspective”. The problem investigated was the shift in the nation’s approach to thepolicy of villages after the reign of New Order. In this era, the policy ofdemocratization and decentralization appeared till the village level. However, thepolicy was not totally implemented in the villages. The aims of this study are: todescribe democracy transformation in the village governance in the transition era, toclarify autonomy transformation in the village governance in the transition era, and toanalyze the implication and the sense of democracy and autonomy transfor mation tothe development of village governance.This study was conducted employing qualitative method. Various forms ofdemocracy and autonomy transformation in the village governance took place duringthe transition era. In the first stage, the primary and secondary data were collected. Inthe second stage, the theory applied for examining the data was chosen, and in thethird stage, the collected and classified data were analyzed and interpreted. In thefourth stage the results of the study were reported and constructed. The theoriesapplied in this study include; democracy, political democracy, substantial democracy,decentrali zation and political culture. The approaches applied were Tranpolitic andpost-structuralism.The results of the study showed that; first, the village democracy in the firsttransition era (1998-1999) was mostly still uniform, and there were not many choicesin the implementation of the village democracy. The village autonomy was stillblocked in centralistic pattern, homogeneous with hierarchical structure. Second, inthe second transition era (2000-2004) the role of the village representatives became sodemocratic accompanied by the extended village autonomy. Third, in the thirdtransition era (2005-2008) democracy became retransformed to the procedural patternaccompanied by the strengthening of supra village government power decreasing theautonomy of the villages.

11,"This dissertation discusses the representation of the Divine and human being imagery in theentity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza in the village of Guru Sina in Ngada Regency, Flores. The empiricproblems of this dissertasion are connected with the marginalized phenomenon of the local religionthat submerged in the entity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza and its ritual practices. This probelm is relevant tobe investigated from the perspectives cultural studies.The problems raised in this study are : 1) the representation of the Divine and human beingimagery in the entity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza, 2) the representation of the relationhip between the Divineand human being in ritual practices of Sa’o Ngaza, and 3) the meaning of the representation of theDivine and human being imagery in the entity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza. This study applies the qualitativemethod and the data collection was done using techniques of intensive interview, participationobservation,and documentation. The data were analyzed using the theory of ritus, the theory ofprocess,the theory of semiotics, and the theory of deconstruction.The findings of the study can be explained as follows. Firstly, the representation of theDivine imagery is dyadic and triadic. In the dyadic imagery representation, The Divine is depicted as’The Giver of an Unlimited Love and at the same time as ’The Unpredictable Taker of Love’. In thetriadic representation, The Divine is depicted as The Sacred, in the attributive as ‘The Beginning’,‘The End’, and ‘The Present Throughout’. In the dyadic imagery, the human being consists of theelements of the body and the soul, and in the triadic imagery, the human being consists of theelements of the body, the psyche, and the spirit.Secondly, the relation between the Divine and human being is representatively revealed inthe ritual practices of legitimating Sa’o Ngaza. This relation centers in the methapor of relationshipbetween the simbolic body dan the religious body, and affirms the status of human being as ’thewrapper of divinity seed’ and ‘His image’.Thirdly, the meaning of the representation of the Divine and human being imagery in theentity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza is sacral , spiritual, and moral. The sacral value pertains to the dinamicrelationship between the human being and the Divine in a sacral way and the sacral place. TheSpiritual value pertains to the relation intra-human being and his spiritual opened and connectedthrough inner feeling with the One Sacral in the strong effort of making the human being perfect.The moral value pertains to a good relationship among human beings themselves in accordance withtheir norms of community.The findings of the study enrich the theory of process about the concept of the Divine fromWhitehead and contrast with the theory of ritus as the choreography of violence from Smedal. In theentity of ritus Sa’o Ngaza, there is a unique concept of human being in the design of ulu palicarvings, which describes the ideology of leadership in the local tradition. The finding of thisconcept can become the model of implementation of the decostruction theory and the semiotictheory which removes and deconstructs binary opposition between the leader (ulu) and the follower(eko).","THE REPRESENTATION OF THE DIVINE AND HUMAN BEING IMAGERY IN THE ENTITY OF RITUS SA’O NGAZA IN GURU SINA, NGADA, FLORES",2012-11-26,E-JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES,the representation of the divine and human being imagery in the entity of rite sao ngaza in the village of guru sina ngada flores this dissertation discusses the representation of the divine and human being imagery in the entity of rite sao ngaza in the village of guru empirical problems of this dissertation are connected with the marginalized phenomenon of the local religion that is submerged in the entity of rite sao ngaza and its ritual practices this problem is relevant to be investigated from the perspectives of cultural studies the problems raised in this study are the representation of the divine and human beingimagery in the entity of the Sao Ngaza rite meaning of the representation of the divine and human being imagery in the entity of rite sao ngaza this study applies the qualitative method and the data collection was carried out using techniques of intensive interview participation observation and documentation the data were analyzed using the theory of rites the theory of process the theory of semiotics and the theory of deconstruction the findings of the study can be explained as follows firstly the representation of the divine imagery is dyadic and triadic in the dyadic imagery representation the divine is depicted as the giver of an unlimited love and at the same time as the unpredictable taker of love in the triadic representation the divine is depicted as the sacred in the attributive as the beginning the end and the present throughout in the dyadic imagery the human being consists of the elements of the body and the soul and in the triadic imagery the human being consists of the elements of the body the psyche and the spirit secondly the relationship between the divine and human being is representatively revealed in the ritual practices of legitimating sao ngaza this relationship centers in the metamorphosis of relationship between the symbolic body and the religious body and affirms the status of human being as the wrapper of divinity seed and his image thirdly the meaning of the representation of the divine and human being imagery in theentity of rite sao ngaza is sacred spiritual and moral the sacred value maintains to the dynamic relationship between the human being and the divine in a sacred way and the sacred place the spiritual value maintains to the relation intrahuman being and his spiritual opened and connected through inner feeling with the one sacred in the strong effort of making the human being perfect the moral value maintains to a good relationship among human beings themselves in accordance with their norms of community the findings of the study enrich the theory of process about the concept of the divine from whitehead and contrast with the theory of rites as the choreography of violence from smedal in the entity of ritus sao ngaza there is a unique concept of human being in the design of ulu palicarvings which describes the ideology of leadership in the local tradition the finding of this concept can become the model of implementation of the decostruction theory and the semiotic theory which removes and deconstructs binary opposition between the leader ulu and the follower,23382449,11

The reason is that such attempts can accelerate the gender equality in politics. This present study is intended to understand and describe the factors contributing to the women’s struggle for the position as legislators. The study used the critical theory and the descriptive qualitative theory. The data were obtained through observation and in-depth interview.

The close relationship between human beings and the culture proves that human beings cannot live without culture; how primitive they are, as exemplified by the life of the Culambacu ethnic people. Based on such an assumption, the monsehe ritual becomes an interesting thing to explore. The problems of the present study can be formulated as follows: how the monsehe ritual performed by the Culambacu ethnic people is like; what ideologies contribute to the monsehe ritual; and what meaning it contains. The data in the present study were collected through observation, interview, library research, and documentation. The theory of functional structure, the theory of semiotics, and the theory of hegemony were used to analyze the problems of the study.

In relation to that, this study describes the cultural phenomenon of religioustransformation as the ideological basis of the pre-modern, modern and postmodern communities.Multidisciplinary qualitative method was employed in this study and the data needed werecollected by in-depth interview, participatory observation and documentation techniques. Thefindings show that the Seni Dodod has the belief or the religion adhered to by the people living atMekar Wangi Village as its religious background. Such a belief affects the relation patternbetween the individuals and their community, nature and God. This is used as the reference inwhat is done in the agricultural process, making Seni Dodod a cult and realizatrion. When thecultural transformation process was taking place, it was found that there was a point of contactbetween traditional arts and modern arts outside the domain of Seni Dodod . Nowadays newcompositions of Seni Dodod have been created functioning as instruments of wedding andkhitanan rituals (khitanan = a feast celebrating a circumcision). The process of acculturation wasformally performed at school by using its compositions as the learning material of art andculture. Its application in its original form and composition was informally inherited throughSeni Dodod studios, the youth and villagers. Its religious meaningfulness was reflected from thecountry life performed by the people living at Mekar Wangi village. Such meaningfulness wasbased on that given by the leaders of pondok pesantren (Muslem boarding school) and on theexplanation clarifying, showing, separating and elaborating seven clauses of Al-Qur’an. Themeaningfulness provided resulted in intactness of movements, the costumes worn, the poem oflutung kasarung , the magic formula or the prayers used. In addition, it was also referred to asMuslim art and culture. It seems that nowadays a shift has taken place as far as its function isconcerned.

11,"Kakebyaran art is a performing art with the Balinese identity; it is not only popular in Bali but also in the other provinces in Indonesia and different parts of the world. In Indonesia, such a performing art is also performed in Mataram City, West Nusa Tenggara. The policy with the jargon “Maju, Religious and Berbudaya” (Being Developed, Religious, and Cultured),  which was issued by the ruler of Mataram City, affirms that the development in Mataram City is oriented toward the Islamic religious values, meaning that the other religious and cultural symbols are reduced. Such a situation has motivated the Balinese ethnic community to develop its art, tradition, and culture in general and the kekebyaran art in particular. Such a phenomenon is a domain of cultural studies which is very interesting to be explored in depth. There are three problems related to such a phenomenon. They are 1) the form and function of the reproduction of the kekebyaran art, 2) the factors contributing to the reproduction of the kekebyaran , 3) the impact of the reproduction of the kekebyaran art on and its meaning to the society of Mataram City, West Nusa Tenggara. The present study was conducted using the qualitative method, in accordance with the scientific norm and paradigm of cultural studies. Three theories were used to analyze such problems; they are the theory of cultural reproduction, the theory of identity, and the theory of semiotics. They were eclectically used to discuss the substance of the topic of discussion. The results of analysis were formulated as follows: first, the form of the reproduction of the kekebyaran art is made up of musicality, the instrumental form, the way of presenting it, its function as part of a ritual and a performing art, and its function to strengthen the local culture.

The result of the study shows that Pitamaha is the first modern association of arts in Bali. However, Pitamaha still integrated the pattern of the Balinese traditional association. In this association, the royal elites were involved as the mediators between Spies and Bonnet and the Balinese painters. Spies and Bonnet taught the modern arts which were different from and even contrasted with the Balinese arts and design. However, the Pitamaha painters welcome it. This could not be separated from the practice of teaching through hegemony and domination which contrasted with what had been desired by the Balinese painters who intended to maintain the Balinese arts and design.
